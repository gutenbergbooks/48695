<h2>INTRODUCTION<br />

<small>By <span class="smcap">Robert H. Davis</span></small></h2>


<p>Cooking is a gift, not an art. Eating is an art, not
a gift. In combination a grace is developed. No great
culinary triumph was ever perfected by accident.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb’s essay on roast pig was responsible
for a tidal wave of burnt pork that swept over England
in the nineteenth century. Mr. Lamb led a hungry empire
to the belief that only through an act of incendiarism
could a suckling porker be converted into a delicacy;
whereas, as a matter of fact, the perfection of roast pork,
golden-brown and unseared by fire, were possible only in
the oven.</p>

<p>Lucullus, the good Roman gourmet, had his meals
cooked in a mint. He required that his masterpieces be
served on gold and silver and crystal, and spread on a
table of lapis lazuli. The sauces compiled for him were
worth more than the food upon which they were poured.
He was the high priest of extravagance and luxury. A
single meal stood him a fortune. He had more regard
for the cost than for the cooking. It is said that his
death was hastened by dyspepsia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the early seventies a French nobleman, living in the
neighborhood of Barbizon, was found seated at the table
with his face in a plate of soup. Because of the fact that
a butcher knife had been inserted via the back between
his fourth and fifth rib on the left side, he was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
dead. Clues led nowhere. It became one of the mysteries.</p>

<p>Long afterward an old man tottered into the office of
the Prefect and announced that he wished to make a
confession.</p>

<p>“Proceed,” said the official.</p>

<p>“’Twas I,” responded the ancient, “who delivered the
death stroke to the Duke de la —— thirty-five years ago.”</p>

<p>“What inspired you to make this confession?”</p>

<p>“Pride.”</p>

<p>“I do not comprehend. The details, if you please.”</p>

<p>“By profession I was a chef,” said the self-accused.
“The Duke, at a fabulous price, enticed me into his service.
His first request was that I make for him a perfect
consomme. <i>Voilà!</i> For three days I prepared this
perfection. With my own hand I placed before him
the soup tureen. With my own hand I ladled it out.
He inhaled its divine essence; and then, Your Honor,
<i>he reached for the salt</i>. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> I destroy him!”</p>

<p>The Prefect embraced the artist and took him out to
lunch. Thus art was vindicated and the incident closed.
In the chemistry of cooking, “enough is too much.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The immortals who have contributed recipes to this
volume were born with a silver spoon not in their mouths,
but in their hands. The cap and apron, not the cap and
bells, is the garb in which they perform. Secrets handed
down through generations are thrown with a wanton
hand on the pages that comprise this volume. Sauces
from the south, chowders from New England, barbecued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
masterpieces from the west, grilled classics from field and
stream, ragouts, stews, desserts, dressings are hung within
reach of all, like garlic clusters from the rafters of opportunity.
Reach up and help yourself.</p>

<p>Be not disturbed by occasional jocund phrases in this
symposium. Behind them is probably concealed a savory
or a flavor. A long paragraph may conclude with full
particulars concerning the architecture of a gastronomic
dream. Turn the pages slowly lest you be overwhelmed
by the richness of the menu.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The late King Edward, upon bidding the later Carlos
of Portugal God-speed back to his native shores, inquired:
“By what were you most impressed during your visit
to the British Isles?”</p>

<p>“Roast beef,” said Carlos, expanding in ecstasy.</p>

<p>“And what else?” inquired Edward.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Carlos, “the boiled beef wasn’t so damned
bad.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is one thing to cook food, and another to consume
it. This inspired tome is the product of cooks who are not
afraid to take their own medicine. The names of many
of the dishes catalogued herein lies on the tongues of the
mob, but the delicacies themselves do not. This book
brings within the reach of all opportunities that up to
now have been denied them. Given a first class stove,
a few simple ingredients and a copy of this book, hunger
can be abolished wherever English is read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rossini, the musician, also a chef, after writing the
score of <i>The Barber of Seville</i>, was informed by the director
that a prelude was required immediately. Rossini repaired
to his kitchen, cooked himself a perfect dinner,
consumed it alone, and went to bed where in a reclining
position with score sheets all about him, he wrote a brilliant
introduction to his brilliant opera. Suddenly a gust
of wind entered unbidden at the window and scattered
the precious sheets about the room. Several disappeared
through the lattice. Rossini, heavy with the consequences
of his culinary genius, re-wrote a fresher and better prelude,
tucked it under his corpulent person and rolled
over for a final nap, after which he hastened to the opera
house with his masterpiece. His best work was done on
a full stomach.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Brillat-Savarin, author of “Gastronomy as a Fine Art,”
rather whimsically names “Gasteria” the tenth and fairest
of the Muses. The writers of this book name her as
the first.</p>

<h2>I<br />

<small><i>Meredith Nicholson</i></small></h2>


<h3>WABASH VALLEY STEAK</h3>

<p>No man can be a hero in his own kitchen. No man
with the slightest regard for domestic peace will ever
permit his wife to see him cook without having outsiders
present. The psychology of this is obvious. Impatient
though a woman may be of her husband’s attempts to
show that he is a real sport and skilled in all the arts
of social entertaining, before guests she is likely to manifest
a modest degree of pride in his performances. Or
even if slightly contemptuous she is moved to assume a
chaffing attitude that adds to the general good feeling.
I beg not to be confused with the type of bachelor club
man who is a perfect wizard with the chafing dish. I
have always viewed those birds with suspicion. Their
tricks are few and easy of accomplishment—stunts with
mushrooms, or chicken à la king done nonchalantly in a
dinner coat. I sing my fiercest hymn of hate of those
persons.</p>

<p>My own method is to assume full charge of an orderly
kitchen, removing coat and waistcoat, donning an apron
and attacking the job without apology or simper or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
silly pretense that I’m not sure of the result. Not sure!
Except in the case of colored women cooks, who trust
to inspiration and achieve miracles without, seemingly,
knowing how they do ’em—except, I say, in such instances,
cookery is an exact science. If you follow a
good rule and know how to regulate the range and have
a true eye and acute nose, failure is obliterated from the
lexicon.</p>

<p>And now for my scenario, which I stole from a lady,
who in turn stole it, I dare say, from some cook book.
I might pretend that I invented it, but I didn’t. All I
claim is that it offers an Olympian feast—particularly if
you can accompany it with hot biscuits, which I admit
are beyond my powers. </p>


<h3><i>The Recipe</i></h3>

<p>Take a round steak cut two inches thick; and beat a
cup of flour into it. Heat a large skillet till it is piping
hot with lard covering the bottom about one inch. Put
in the steak, cover immediately, and allow it to cook
about five minutes, turning once.</p>

<p>Then cover it with a sauce composed in this wise:</p>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Four large tomatoes</li>
<li>Four onions</li>
<li>Four green mango peppers</li>
<li>Four ripe pimentoes</li>
</ul>



<p>Put through a grinder or better still chop thoroughly
with a chopper in a wooden bowl. Don’t skimp on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
labor; the chopping must be done conscientiously. Season
with salt and pour over the steak; cook slowly for two
hours. When done turn into a large platter and serve
piping hot.</p>

<h3>ONION CLAM CHOWDER</h3>

<p>To each 10 oz. can of Pioneer Brand Minced Clams
use 1 pound of sliced Spanish or white onion.</p>

<p>For a good sized chowder take six large onions (white),
and cut in lengths one inch long. Pour the juice from
the clams into saucepan, add onions and a little water
and boil thoroughly until onions are well cooked and
soft. Then add clams which have been taken out of
the can and put into a dish, and stew five minutes before
onions are done. Next place in a stew pan about a pint
of cream or half cream and half milk and let come to a
boil. After the clams have been in with the onions for
about three minutes pour on the hot milk and season to
taste with salt and pepper. If serving in a soup plate, a
little chopped parsley adds to the attractiveness of the
dish. Then EAT it.</p>

<p>(You can substitute for fresh milk or cream—Carnation
Canned Milk diluted—⅔ milk to ⅓ water. The soup
should be thick and not too watery. This can be regulated
by amount of milk added.)</p>

<h3>SPAGHETTI</h3>

<p>Take one package of vermicelli or spaghetti, and put
it into a saucepan, crushing it in the hand, then put in
hot water, and salt a little more than will suit the taste,
and boil for an hour.</p>

<p>While the vermicelli or spaghetti is cooking, take a
quart of milk and heat three-quarters—or 24 ounces—of
it until it boils. Then stir into the eight ounces of cold
milk a level cupful of flour, or two tablespoonfuls of flour,
pretty well heaped, and then stir the thickened milk into
the boiling milk and cook slowly for ten minutes.</p>

<p>Then add three-quarters of a pound of good, ripe, old
American cheese, and about half a pound of butter. Then
drain the water off the vermicelli or spaghetti and put
in from one and one half pints to a quart of canned
tomatoes. Heat the vermicelli or spaghetti to the boiling
point; and while the mixture of cheese, butter, milk and
flour is still hot, stir the two together, then keep hot and
serve hot. Do not boil any more, because further boiling
would tend to cause the tomatoes to coagulate the milk
in the mixture. I prefer to use a mixture of spaghetti and
vermicelli instead of all spaghetti or all vermicelli.</p>

<h3>WAFFLES</h3>

<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 pint milk</li>
<li>flour to make thin batter</li>
<li>2 large teaspoons of baking powder</li>
</ul>


<p>Beat yolks of eggs, add sugar and salt, melt butter, add
milk and flour; last just before ready to bake add beaten
whites of eggs and baking powder.</p>

<p>Bake on hot waffle iron.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—There is a great deal of argument about
the proper dressing for waffles. Various gravies are used by
one school of waffle eaters; while honey, maple syrup, and
various specially flavored sugar powders are preferred by
another.</p>

<p>President Harding is a staunch upholder of the gravy
school and likes his in the form of creamed chipped beef.</p></div>

<h3>BOUILLABAISSE JOE TILDEN</h3>

<p>In a soup kettle put four tablespoonsful of genuine olive
oil. When hot enough fry in it two large onions, sliced,
and two cloves of garlic chopped. Cut two pounds of
any sort of firm white-textured fish into small pieces and
put in the kettle, just covering the mixture with warm
water.</p>

<p>Now have the Eighteenth Amendment repealed and add
to the mixture one cup of White Wine, the juice of half
a lemon, two large tomatoes (peeled and cut up), pepper,
salt and one or two bay leaves.</p>

<p>Cook this briskly for twelve minutes, by which time the
liquor should be one third evaporated. Now add a tablespoonful
of chopped parsley. Joe Tilden added a pinch of
saffron, but I don’t care for it. Cook two minutes longer
and serve ladled on slices of French bread.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—Moquin’s have made a luncheon specialty
of Bouillabaisse for many years. They add lobster and eel.
Here is a wonderful dish to experiment with—great fun and
delicious results if you try it once or twice. It’s a habit-forming
dish, so beware!</p></div>

<h3>RADISH SALAD</h3>

<p>The French ambassador presents his compliments and
begs to state that he does not believe that any dish, or
food, is more palatable than a salad of radishes, the
radishes to be cut in very thin slices and to be seasoned
with the usual salad dressing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—This salad will be at its best if the foundation,
upon which the thin slices of radish are placed, is made
of small crisp leaves of romaine. The usual dressing—french,
of course—is prepared in this way:</p>

<p>To one tablespoonful of lemon or vinegar add three tablespoonsful
of the best olive oil, a dash of black pepper, and a
half teaspoonful of salt. Beat well with a silver fork, and add
enough paprika to give it a ruddy color, and a rich flavor.
If the salad dish is rubbed with garlic it will do no great
harm to the mixture!</p></div>

<h3>RICE PUDDING</h3>

<p>I am president of the S. R. R. R. P.—the Society for
Restoration of Raisins to Rice Pudding.</p>

<p>I have made a list of New York hotels and clubs and
rated them according to the number of raisins they put
in a portion of rice pudding as follows:</p>


<ul class='ingredients'><li>Class D—no raisins</li>
<li>Class C—1 raisin</li>
<li>Class B—3 or more raisins</li>
<li>Class A—plenty of raisins</li></ul>



<p>To my mind, rice pudding without raisins is like Hamlet
without the eggs.</p>


<ul class='ingredients'>
<li>1 cup rice</li>
<li>4 cups milk</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>½ cup sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt</li>
<li>1 package seedless raisins</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of vanilla</li></ul>



<p>Bake one hour in a hot oven. Set the pan inside of
another containing hot water.</p>

<p>Serve with whipped cream and garnish with Dromedary
dates.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—Cook the rice twenty-three minutes.</p></div>

<h3>LIEDERKRANZ Á LA HOOSIER</h3>

<p>Run around and find a real nice Liederkranz cheese
and treat it as follows to get a serving for four people:</p>

<p>Mix the cheese with about a quarter of a pound of
butter and work into a fine paste, adding salt, pepper,
French mustard, paprika and Worcestershire sauce as
you go along. Just add them to taste.</p>

<p>When the paste is smooth put in one finely chopped
small green pepper; one small onion, or chives.</p>

<p>Mix well!</p>

<p>And serve on rye bread—spread thick. To be thoroughly
technical, I suppose I should have said: spread
to taste!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—You can have a wonderful time and make
quite a reputation for yourself by inventing cheese combinations.
Ordinary cream cheese makes a splendid base for
original mixtures. Try combinations of finely minced pimento,
celery, olives, chives and peppers (green and red). And
anything else that promises well.</p></div>

<h3>CORN CHOWDER</h3>

<p><i>I believe my favorite recipe is Corn Chowder.</i></p>

<p>The appetite for this dish must be approached from
the windy side of a promontory in early spring with a
sixty pound pack between the shoulder blades, aforementioned
pack to contain for a couple of congenial souls
a pound of bacon, a pound of dry onions, two cans of
corn and one large tin of condensed milk.</p>

<p>Cut the bacon up into small half inch squares and start
it frying. Simultaneously slice the onions and give them
the heat. If, after the aroma from these two begins to
permeate the air, you feel like risking their falling into
the fire, start boiling the corn and milk. Before the onions
are too thoroughly cooked stir them into the bacon, at
which time the battle for the supremacy of the appetizing
odors is occupying most of your attention.</p>

<p>Now throw the bacon and onions into the corn pot
and wait as long as you are able so that the ingredients
become thoroughly familiar with one another.</p>

<p>Write me as soon as you get home if you don’t remember
that day until you are an old man.</p>

<p>To make this sound extremely professional I suppose
I should add, “Season to taste,” but do not mind if a few
ashes get mixed in by mistake.</p>

<h3>COD FISH</h3>

<p>Here is my favorite dish. Viz.:—Fresh Labrador Codfish
caught during the Caplin school. The fish is at this
time in splendid condition.</p>

<p>Here is the recipe:</p>

<p>Place a small bake pot upon a wood fire; then take a
few strips of fat pork, cut up into small pieces and put
into the bake pot. When the pork fat has melted you
cut the fish into several small pieces and place in the
pot. In about twenty minutes the fish is cooked. The
fish must be eaten from the pot with a wooden spoon.</p>

<h3>SWEET POTATO PONE</h3>

<p>There are two sure ways of identifying a true southerner.
One of them is to play “Dixie.” Unlike your
northerner, or counterfeit southerner who springs to his
feet and looks exalted and proud when the band strikes
up that swinging anthem, your true, or southern southerner
rarely springs. Generally he just sets and waggles
one boot, and looks happy or sentimental, according to
his nature. That is one way of detecting your true
southerner. The second and surer way is to announce in
a tremulous voice: “Gemmen, dat potato pone am done
set.”</p>

<p>The sweet potato pone is strictly a southern dish. It
is served south of the Mason and Dixon line hot and
smoking. You don’t need much experience as a cook,
although the old rule which also places “perfect” after
“practice” of course holds good. Your ninth potato pone
will be better than your third. Here is the how:</p>

<p>Grind up raw sweet potatoes in a meat chopper until
you have one quart. Mix the grindings thoroughly in a
bowl with molasses—enough molasses so the mass is soft
and sticky, or spongy.</p>

<p>Mix in a heaping tablespoonful of lard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Add a teaspoonful of allspice.</p>

<p>Put the mixture in a cake tin and place in a slow oven.
Stir constantly until a rich brown hue is attained, then
smooth over with a knife or spoon and allow to bake
slowly until a mellow brown crust is formed.</p>

<p>Remove from oven, allow to cool slightly, cut in slices
and serve. General Robert E. Lee would walk ten miles
for a slice of it.</p>

<h3>VEGETABLE SALAD</h3>

<p>My idea of good food is a vegetable salad. Any kind
of a vegetable salad is good; some are better than others.
Here is a recipe for a French dressing on a lettuce salad
which you should try on your meat grinder, or your
potato masher, or your rolling pin or whatever kitchen
utensil you can play.</p>

<p>Get a crisp head of lettuce, discard the outer green
leaves, using the inner yellow and white. Wash it thoroughly,
and after pulling it apart dry each leaf with a
tea towel. Put it in a big bowl—a big mixing bowl, six
inches deep anyway. Then set that to one side, and get
about as much onion as the end of your first finger would
make, if it was chopped off at the second joint. Mince
that. Put it in the bottom of a bowl. Take a large
tablespoon; put in salt and paprika to taste, and don’t be
afraid of making it salty, then add oil and vinegar, about
three or four to one, mixing them in the spoon until it
slops over into the onion, and then stir the salt and
paprika and oil and vinegar down into the bowl of minced
onion, taking a salad fork and jabbing it around in the
mixture until the onion has been fairly well crushed and
the onion flavor permeates the mixed oil and vinegar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the salt and paprika have become for the moment a part
of the mass. Don’t let it stand a second, but pour it
quickly into the bowl of dry lettuce, and then stir like
the devil. Keep on stirring; stir some more, and serve
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Cheese may be mashed into the onion before putting
on the oil and vinegar and paprika and salt. If one
wants to add tomatoes, wait until the last three jabs of
the stirring fork into the lettuce, and then quarter the
tomatoes and turn them in just before you turn the lettuce
over the last two or three times. This is done so that
the watery juice of the tomatoes won’t get smeared over
the oil on the lettuce leaves. If you stir the tomatoes in
early, you get a runny, watery, gooey mess. Cucumbers
may be added, and they should be stirred in rather earlier
than the tomatoes in the business of mixing the lettuce
leaves and the dressing. Green peppers may be added if
they are cut into strings, but too much outside fixings
spoils the salad for me. The tomatoes are about as far
as one can go wisely.</p>

<p>For a person who has written so copiously about food

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—Hog Jowl, Paducah Style, may be prepared
like this:</p>

<p>Get the jowl. Some prefer it cooked and served with the
bone; others remove the bone before serving. Boil it in well
salted water for thirty minutes, then add the turnip greens and
boil at least thirty minutes longer. Serve with plenty of butter
for dressing; a dash of vinegar and a semi-colon of mustard
are used by some folks who are hard to please.</p>

<h3>HAWAIIAN CROQUETTES Á LA “THE
BIRD OF PARADISE”</h3>

<p>It was about fifteen years ago that I first visited the
Hawaiian Islands in search of material for my play, “The
Bird of Paradise,” and during the course of my sojourn
I made many friends among the natives, often living weeks
at a time with them in out-of-the-way villages. Although
their food was radically different from ours in many of its
contents and modes of making, it was always palatable,
and often strikingly delicious. However, most of the
native dishes contained ingredients which we cannot obtain
here, but I did learn how to make what some of
my friends have nick-named Hawaiian Croquettes à la
“Bird of Paradise,” the materials for which are easily procured.
And it is a dish so wonderfully appetizing that I
constantly prepare it for guests of epicurean tastes.</p>

<p>First grate the meat of half a cocoanut, and add to it
a cup of (cow’s) milk, mixing thoroughly, and straining
through cloth. Melt two tablespoonsful of butter over
a low flame, rubbing into it with the back of a spoon
five tablespoonsful of flour, stirring until very smooth.
Then add slowly the strained cocoanut and milk liquid,
stirring constantly until very thick. Season meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with one and a half teaspoonsful of salt; one of paprika,
and one of grated onion. Finally add two cups of cold,
boiled, shredded mullet, or any other firm white fish, and
two cups of cold, boiled, chopped lobster, and after stirring
allow to cool.</p>

<p>Shape into croquettes, or balls, allowing a rounded
tablespoonful to each ball; roll in fine cracker crumbs;
dip into an egg which has been slightly beaten and to
which one-quarter of a cup of water has been added; again
roll in cracker crumbs.</p>

<p>Have a deep pan of fat, hot enough to fry a piece of
bread a golden brown while you count forty, and cook the
croquettes therein for about a minute; then drain on
paper, and serve with olives.</p>

<h3>LIKES BREAD AND MILK</h3>

<p>A recipe of my favorite dish is very simple—bread and
milk with American cheese broken into it. I eat this
dish once a day every day and find it wholesome and
nourishing. It does not require any skillful putting together,
simply a good appetite and a taste for that sort
of provender. If there is an apple pie anywhere around
to top it off with, I do not despise that.</p>

<p>I find as a rule that the simpler and more elementary
the food, the better so far as the body is concerned. And
take it the year around a bowl of milk with fresh bread
and rich American cheese, finishing up with “good apple
pie like mother used to make,” is all the midday meal
I need. I can work on that all the afternoon and feel
better than if I had had a seven course dinner.</p>

<h3>“JAMES MONTGOMERY SUDS”</h3>

<p>This is a dessert. When a Swedish cook is put on her
mettle to suggest a dessert—something different—she
stands a while in uffish thought, then breaks out into a
smile of satisfaction and says “Snow Pudding”! It’s
Swede law. The Swedes <i>must</i> suggest Snow Pudding
when asked for an original thought in the dessert line.</p>

<p>So this dessert of mine was a protest.</p>

<p>There is one very difficult ingredient—wine jelly! The
jelly is easy enough, but where in Jell do you get the
wine?</p>

<p>If you don’t have wine jelly—it’s all off—no use beginning.
If you can get the wine then you put some
cut-up oranges in wine jelly with an inch layer of beaten
whites of eggs on top and lightly brown this. A loose
custard is poured on each helping. It sounds rather punk
and ladieshomejournalish but is a perfectly good dessert.</p>

<h3>“EGGS MUSHROOMETTE”</h3>

<p>This is the queen of breakfast dishes and should be
served, of course, with broiled ham, the king of breakfast
dishes, hot buttered toast, and several cups of fresh-made,
fragrant and just-strong-enough-to-bring-out-full-flavor,
percolated coffee! </p>


<h4><i>Recipe</i></h4>

<p>Peel and slice a half pound of fresh mushrooms and
cook in butter in old-fashioned frying pan till nearly
done. The pan is now good and hot. Moderate the heat
and put in three fresh eggs and fry them very slowly,
constantly basting top of eggs with the hot butter the
mushrooms have been cooking in. Cook well, slowly and
thoroughly till all the mushrooms that attach are nestling
in the white of the eggs like plums in a pudding. Serve,
when thoroughly cooked, with the broiled ham, fresh
coffee, and hot buttered toast.</p>

<p>This dish, as here described, is for one person only—as
it is too good to be shared with anybody else.</p>

<p>P. S.—Eggs should never be fried so quickly that
the whites are cooked to isinglass. Cook them slowly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
surely, thoroughly and baste with hot mushroom butter
as directed, and you will have Eggs Mushroomette and

<h3>ARTICHOKES, MISTER ANTONIO</h3>

<p>Force a small opening in the head of the artichoke by
giving it a blow upon the table. Then, into the center
pour a dessertspoonful of olive oil in which a little salt
and pepper have been mixed. To this add a quarter of
a clove of garlic.</p>

<p>Place the artichokes in such position that they may not
be overturned. Surround them with cold water, and
allow them to boil, covered and undisturbed, for half
an hour.</p>

boiled hay.</p>

<h3>A BURGOO</h3>

<p>Clean and dress the meat of a soft-shelled turtle, a
painted turtle, a poker-dot turtle, or almost any other
kind of turtle. Clean and dress a rabbit, a ruffled grouse,
moose meat, elk meat, deer meat, sheep meat, in fact
any sort of game. Cut your meat into pieces about the
size of inch cubes. Save the bones, especially the marrow
bones, to put in with the meat. Add some salt pork cut
into cubes, if you have it.</p>

<p>If you have been thoughtful enough to supply your
outfit with some ill-smelling, but palatable dry vegetables,
they will add flavor to your burgoo, put all the material
in a kettle, and fill the kettle half full of water. If
you have beans and potatoes do not put them in with
the meat because they will go to the bottom and
scorch. While the stuff you have already put in the
kettle is boiling, or simmering, peel your onions and
quarter them, scrape your carrots and slice them, peel your
potatoes, cut them up into pieces—about inch cubes.
After your caldron has commenced to boil dump in the
fresh vegetables, they will cool off the water and kill
the boil. Do not let it come to a boil again, but put
it over a slow fire and allow it to simmer. There should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
always be enough water to cover the vegetables. A can
of tomatoes will add greatly to the flavor. Use no sweet
vegetables like beets or sweet potatoes. Put the salt and
pepper in just before you take it off the fire. When the
burgoo is done, strain it into tin cups. The liquid out of
an olive bottle adds greatly to the flavor if you pour it
in while the stew is cooking. If you have such luxuries
in camp as olives and lemons, a slice of lemon with an
olive in each cup over which the liquid is poured makes
a dish too good for any old king that ever lived.</p>

<p>The excellence of a burgoo depends upon two things,
the materials you have of which to make it and the care
you take in cooking it. No two burgoos are alike, and
every one I ever tasted was mighty good. Civilized
material such as can be purchased at the butcher shop
and the vegetable store makes a good soup, but the “goo”
isn’t there. Consequently you cannot call it a burgoo.</p>

<h3>RASPBERRY SHORTCAKE</h3>

<p>RASPBERRY SHORTCAKE, with the assistance of
a rich and kindly disposed cow, meaning lacteal fluid on
same—that is my chief debauch! </p>


<h4><i>Recipe</i> (<i>for two people</i>)</h4>

<p>Sift a level teaspoonful of baking powder and a scant
half teaspoonful of salt through a cupful of flour. See
that the mixture is thorough. Take lard or butter (butter
is best) and work it well into the flour until it crumbles
under the fingers. Use plenty of finger work. Now add
a very small quantity of milk and work into a dough that
is easily rolled and flattened on a floured board. Roll
out and cut in round cakes to fit cake tins. Have cakes
about a half inch thick. Bake in a moderate oven until
light golden in color. In serving have lots of berries—half
of them—crushed. Split the shortcakes and butter
them, if desired. Above all use thick, rich cream in generous
doses. The dish is really best when the cakes are
just from the oven—instead of cold.</p>

<p>The same goes for strawberry shortcake and makes
the only <i>real genuine old-fashioned shortcake</i>.</p>

<h3>TOMATO SOUP</h3>

<p>I have a fondness for tomato soup and steak without
grizzles. Since almost any one can broil a steak I’ll pass
that up and tell you how to play cream of tomato right
around the kitchen course in par.</p>

<p>You can take ripe tomatoes, cut them up, stew them
and put them through a strainer. You can add a bit of
soup stock and seasoning and all that, but the easy way
is to take some of Mr. Campbell’s tomato soup and add
milk instead of water—only use more soup, per person,
than the can label calls for.</p>

<p>Don’t boil it—but when the soup is good and hot give
it a bit of informal seasoning and then stir in <i>a lot</i> of stiff
whipped cream. Keep back enough of the whipped cream
to put a big spoonful of it in the center of each plate.</p>

<p>Use the can opener at the first tee and with luck you’ll
be on the dinner table in an easy three. Play out of the
soup plate with a good sized spoon for a par four—and
there you are!</p>

<p>You’ll be able to whip the cream without detailed
directions. The important thing is choosing the right
egg beater or cream whipper or whatever you use. The
next important thing in whipping cream is stance. You’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
gradually acquire that, after you’ve spattered the front
of your vest a time or two, and hooked a few long ones
to the wall paper. I believe that there are some safety
devices for whipping cream, but they take all the sport
and excitement out of the thing.</p>

<h3>MULLIGAN</h3>

<p>This is a camp dish to be cooked over an open fire.
I guarantee nothing on a stove. I know nothing of stoves,
and have a dark suspicion of them. To make it: Place
in a kettle half full of cold water either (a) fish cut in
chunks, (b) a couple of dozen clams, or (c) a half dozen
chunks of venison about the size of a tennis ball, depending
on whether you want a Fish Mulligan, a Clam Mulligan,
or a Game Mulligan. Also depending on what you
have. Also a half dozen peeled potatoes and three large
onions. Salt and pepper, bring slowly to a boil. Add a
handful of cubes of salt pork or bacon. Simmer slowly
until the potatoes disintegrate. If you have the remains
of a can of corn or a little residue of cold rice or anything
of like nature, drop them in. Next put in all the
stale bread or hard tack the traffic will bear. Dissolve a
tablespoonful of flour in a little warm water, and stir
that in for thickening. Cook slowly until you can’t stand
it any longer, and fly to it.</p>

<h3>FRIED ELDERBERRY BLOSSOMS</h3>

<p>This sounds like a joke but it is a perfectly serious
dish—I made its acquaintance at the table of a little inn
in South Baden, on the shores of Lake Constance.</p>

<p>First you must wait until the elderberry bushes are in
full bloom. Then you gather a good sized bunch of them—and
cut off each blossom just below the point where
the little stems join the main stalk.</p>

<p>These you dip into a light egg batter such as is used
to make apple fritters (lighter, perhaps), taking care to
cover both the flower and as much of the little stalks as
possible. They should be served like fritters as soon as
made.</p>

<h3>PEACH COBBLER</h3>

<p>One of my favorite dishes is peach cobbler. I am told
that it originated in the south, but its fame has spread
far beyond the limits of the Mason and Dixon line. It
is made in this way:</p>

<p>Line a baking dish or pan, about three and one-half
inches deep, with a rich pastry. <i>There must be no break
in the pastry.</i> Then fill the dish to the brim with
peaches—ripe, luscious ones, that have been pared and
broken—not cut—in half. Sugar generously, and leave
in about six or eight of the peach pits—they give a certain
flavor that only peach pits may impart.</p>

<p>Cover the peaches with an <i>unbroken</i> upper crust of
pastry; seal it tightly along the sides, so that none of the
juices or aromas may escape. Bake in a slow oven until
nearly brown—then sprinkle the top with powdered sugar,
that will give a certain professional luster to the dish.
After that finish the browning process.</p>

<p>A cobbler containing a quart of peaches should bake
for about one hour.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—Senator Smoot is not alone in his partiality
toward peach cobbler. Back in the days before Volstead,
famous cobblers were produced just as above with the
addition of brandy, say a cup to a quart of peaches—but that,
of course, was a long time ago.</p></div>

<p>The asparagus bunches are placed in a double boiler
upright, the tips being above the water, and thus cooked
by steam. Passed at table, with the asparagus, is hard-boiled
egg, put through a ricer, a small quantity of finely
ground nutmeg and a dish of hot, melted butter. It

and put into stew pan with sufficient fresh butter to stew
it well.</p>

<p>In another pan make a sauce of pre-Prohibition Sherry
or Madeira, flavored with the beaten yolk of one egg,
powdered nutmeg and mace, a pinch of Cayenne pepper,
salt to taste, enlivened with large lump of butter.</p>

<p>If pre-Prohibition Sherry is not available, names and
addresses of seventy-one bootleggers can be supplied.</p>

<p>Stir sauce well, and just before it comes to a boil, take
it off the fire.</p>

<p>Use three or four hard-boiled hens’ eggs to pinch hit
for turtle’s eggs and send to the table piping hot in chafing
dish.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Serve the sauce separately. The terrapin
is frequently ignored by those who prefer the flavor
of the sherry. I am one of them.</p>

<h3>MEAT LOAF</h3>

<p>I have been consulted about very many things, but this
is the first time I have been consulted on gastronomical
matters. But I give herewith, from my camping experience,
the following favorite dish of mine:</p>

<p>Beef, veal, and pork (sirloin steak and chops), ½ pound
each. Cut off the bones and the fat from the beef and
veal, leaving the fat on the pork. Then pass all three
through the meat grinder, chopping fairly fine. Add two
complete raw eggs and some finely sliced bacon (Beechnut
bacon, cut in pieces about 1 inch square) and mix everything
together thoroughly, adding the proper amount of
salt and pepper and if available some celery salt. Form
into the shape of a round loaf.</p>

<p>In a cast iron or cast aluminum frying pan (that is a
pan of sufficiently heavy metal to well distribute the heat
and guard against local burning) melt some butter, then
put the loaf in the melted butter and cover the pan. Heat
on a very low fire, turning over after some time, and
continue for a long time, until very thoroughly cooked
through. Add butter once or twice when absorbed. Then
uncover and greatly raise the fire, turning over after a
little while so as to brown both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Then take out the loaf and put it on a warm platter
or plate. Now pour a cup of cream or rich milk into
the pan, stir until the sediment in the pan is dissolved, and
heat until you get a good brown gravy. Pour this over
the loaf and serve with boiled mealy potatoes. What is
left over can be eaten cold, sliced and served on buttered
toast.</p>

<h3>ROUND STEAK</h3>

<p>Somebody named Johnson, a name with most excellent
vibrations, writes me and says that in spite of rumors he
has heard, to the effect that I have a hired hand or two
to write my stuff, he believes that I honestly wrote all
by myself an article which appeared some time ago over
my name, in which I stated I could cook round steak
so that it would taste as good as fried chicken and be as
tender.</p>

<p>“If you are not bluffing,” he says, “you could do a
world of good to many housekeepers and stag clubs if
you would print your recipe. The writer has worn the
outer coat of enamel off his teeth in a vain attempt to
make himself believe that round steak is as tender as
chicken. Give us a hand, pal.”</p>

<p>Hence, being called, I lay my cards down, face up,
on the table, to wit, namely and as follows:</p>

<p>Have the butcher cut you a round steak thin. A
little thicker than a lead pencil. He will insist on cutting
it thicker, saying it will be juicier and so on. Draw your
revolver and compel him to obey you. Don’t have the
steak too thick.</p>

<p>After cutting the steak from the piece, have him separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
it into portions, each about the size of your hand. Don’t
try to cook the steak all in one piece. It must be in small
sections, just as fried chicken is best when each joint is
cooked separately.</p>

<p>Have the butcher then take his sharp knife (which is
much better for the purpose than any knife you have at
home, because he knows the art of sharpening and you
don’t), and criss-cross each piece, on both sides, don’t
forget. So that each piece will be in tatters, almost ready
to fall apart.</p>

<p>Put in the frying pan plenty of good sweet lard. Don’t
use butter. It will burn. Don’t fry in deep fat, as with
doughnuts, but plenty of fat, as with fried chicken.</p>

<p>Rub each portion of the raw steak in flour. Rub it
in good. Drop into the hot skillet. Cover it with lid.
Keep covered. This cooks it through and makes it tender.</p>

<p>Fry till a golden brown, turning once in a while. You
notice the process is exactly as with fried chicken, Southern
style.</p>

<p>After you lift out the meat, put in the flour, let it
scorch a bit, then pour water and milk mixed into the
hot grease and meat particles left in the skillet. Just how
much, you will have to find out by experiment. Let it boil
up and boil down, keep stirring, until you have gravy
of the right consistency. Flavor according to taste, with
salt and pepper, before cooking. If the result is not good
it is because you have not followed directions.</p>

<p>Round steak not only is cheap, but it is all good meat,
with the minimum of waste, and properly cooked it
TASTES better than any part of the beef.</p>

among others a mountain trout stream; the inspiration

morning and the pursuit. The requirements, just enough
trout plus a few. From the pack basket take a piece of
pork or bacon, fry well in a skillet over a carefully laid
fire. Prepare the fish and roll well in fine bread crumbs
seasoned with salt and pepper. When the fish are done
a golden brown remove from the skillet and partake in
the aboriginal manner, eating from the fingers. Kings

<h3>LAMB CURRY Á LA “OMAR, THE
TENTMAKER”</h3>


<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>1 onion (diced)</li>
<li>1 cup of stock</li>
<li>½ cup of rice water</li>
<li>1 cup of potatoes, which have been previously boiled and diced</li>
<li>2 cups of lamb, cold roast preferred, and cut into the size of dominoes</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of Curry Powder (Cross and Blackwells, or other imported—<i>never domestic</i>)</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: .5em;">Zest of one lemon</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: .5em;">Salt to taste</span></li>
</ul>


<p>Give me the above ingredients, and I will make you
the meat dish which, above all others, is, to my way of
thinking, the most savory and delicious. Eight years ago,
when I was first playing “Omar, the Tentmaker,” I became
acquainted with various members of the Persian
Embassy, who were especially interested in the play because
of its Persian locale, and it was while dining in the
home of one of these gentlemen that I first became initiated
to lamb curry—that is, lamb curry as it really should
be cooked! Begging the recipe from my host, it has ever
since been the favorite pièce-de-résistance in my home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>First of all you brown the onion in olive oil in a deep
pan; then add the stock, rice-water, salt and curry powder;
the latter having been mixed with a little of the rice-water
to insure a smooth sauce. Simmer slowly till the
oil and curry float in dark blobs, add the lamb, and continue
simmering and stirring until just before serving,
when the lemon juice should be dripped in.</p>

<p>Lamb curry should always be served with hot rice,
taking on your fork equal portions of both, increasing the
amount of rice in case you find the curry too hot. Never
drink water with curry, as it intensifies the burning sensation.
The amount of curry powder used in the above
recipe can be increased or decreased according to the individual
taste. Cold cooked shrimps, lobster, veal or
chicken may be used in place of lamb; but never beef.
Personally I find that lamb produces the finest curry dish.</p>

<p>Water sufficient to make the amount of soup required.</p>

<p>Boil until the beef is tender, with the potatoes, then add
the corn and cook until done.</p>


<p class='unindent'><br /><i>Onions</i>—</p>

<p>Slice thin three large onions—boil for half an hour,
drain and cool. Then pour olive oil over them.</p>


<p class='unindent'><br /><i>Banana Paste</i>—</p>

<p>One quart of milk in a double boiler; add two heaping
tablespoonsful of banana flour mixed in a little milk to
a smooth paste, and cook from half hour to an hour.</p>


<p class='unindent'><br /><i>How to Serve</i>—</p>

paste in separate, individual dishes from which each person
may help themselves.</p>

<p>(In South America the yucca and plantains are used
in this dish.)</p>


<h3>YAPINGACHO</h3>

<p>Make potato cakes by the ordinary recipe, but before
shaping them place a piece of cream cheese the size of
a walnut in the center of each; then fry brown in very
little fat.</p>


<p class='unindent'><br /><i>Sauce</i>—</p>

<p>One quart of milk and one half pound of peanuts
ground fine; boil until thick, seasoning with salt, paprika
and butter.</p>

<p>Serve the potato cakes with fried eggs and pour the
sauce over both.</p>

<h3>ROAST BEEF</h3>

<p>My favorite food is Roast Beef, rare, or a good American
sirloin steak, which, I take it, are so simple to prepare
that they need no recipe. </p>


<h4><i>Suggestions</i>:</h4>

<p>1. Stand your roast on two or three thin slices of bacon—not
too fat.</p>

<p>2. On the top of the roast lay three or four thin slices
of lemon—particularly if you like the “outside cut.”</p>

<p>3. If your steak looks a bit fresh rub with lemon juice
(both sides) and allow to stand several hours before broiling
or frying. Don’t be frightened if it turns a bit black—be
glad.</p>

<p>4. Pan may be rubbed with garlic.</p>

<p>5. Steaks should be <i>thick</i>, particularly if you broil.</p>

<h3>CORN FLAKES</h3>

<p>My favorite dish is corn flakes. They should be placed
in a saucer or hollow dish, then lifted in both hands and
rolled for a moment, then dropped back into the dish.
After that an indefinite quantity of cream should be
poured upon them. They should be eaten with a spoon.
I don’t know how to prepare anything else for the table.
I think the best Kennebunkport manner of steaming clams
is as follows:</p>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>A bushel of clams</li>
<li>4 dozen lobsters</li>
<li>4 dozen ears of sweet corn</li>
<li>4 dozen sweet potatoes</li>
<li>4 dozen eggs</li></ul>



<p>A cartload of seaweed, a bonfire burning for six hours
on rocks, then swept away; the lobsters, clams, etc., placed
in the seaweed, and the seaweed on the hot rocks and
covered with BBB canvas. Allow to steam until screams
of distress issue from the seaweed; then be careful what
you eat!</p>

<h3>CHILI CON CARNE</h3>

Carne.</p>

<p>I might have said Terrapin Maryland, or some other
Ritzy dish, but thought I’d better come with a natural.</p>

<p>I’ll play Chili con Carne and tamales as they are served
in California (where I was born) against any dish I’ve
ever forked over. </p>


<h4><i>Recipe</i></h4>

<p>Cut, say, two pounds of good beef in small pieces the
size of the first finger joint. Add some of the chopped
fat, mix and salt.</p>

<p>Put two tablespoonsful of lard in a deep pot and heat.
To this add a chopped onion. When the onion is about
half cooked add the meat. Stir well until the meat has
boiled down in its juice. When it starts to fry add about
one and a half pints of hot water, three tablespoonsful of
Gebhardt’s Eagle Chili Powder and a few buttons of
chopped garlic. Simmer and stir well until the meat is
tender.</p>

<p>The way it’s done is this:</p>

<p>Cut up lamb in small pieces and fry it in a frying pan.
Slice three or four carrots and onions and fry them with
it. When these are nicely browned, put into a pot, cover
with water, and let boil slowly for an hour. Then put
in a few potatoes and turnips (cut up in small pieces),
and boil until done. Season as you see fit.</p>

<h3>BOUILLEBAISSE</h3>

<p>Bouillebaisse is my favorite dish. I make it according to
the recipe of Valentine Blanc, our cook in Nice, where
we lived some years ago. Valentine could neither read
nor write, nor could a story tell, but her Bouillebaisse
was ever so much better than that they make in Marseilles
(and I venture to say in Thackeray’s old restaurant
either).</p>

<p>Melt about a half pound of butter in a sauce pan.
I’m aware that in Marseilles they use oil, but Valentine
used butter. Don’t let the butter burn. Have ready two
large chopped onions—i. e.—onions chopped fine, and two
“dents” of garlic also chopped fine.</p>

<p>Cook these in the butter until tender and without burning.
Have ready three perch and one haddock. That is to
say: cut off the heads and tails. Some people use eels instead
of haddock. I detest eels. Cut into a large saucepan
the heads and tails of the fish with about a quart of water
and let simmer until well cooked, say about half an hour.
Strain out the heads and tails and give them to the cat.</p>

<p>Add the cooked onions and garlic,—butter and all—to
the strained bouillion from the heads and tails and allow
to simmer for half an hour more, after seasoning to taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
with salt and white pepper. Add about a gill of dry
white wine of any variety,—Chablis, Cotes du Rhone or
what not,—the cheaper the wine the better. Now take
two smallish lobsters, alive, and if you have the heart, cut
them into segments and take off the claws and cut <i>them</i>
into segments. Cook the massacred lobster for about a
quarter of an hour in the liquid or liquor or bouillon above
described and add a saltspoonful of dried Spanish saffron,
while the whole is cooking together. If you can get mussels,
cook also with the entire mess, a dozen or so,—in their
shells if the shells be well scrubbed in advance. Somewhere
in this process add about a tablespoonful of chopped
parsley. Last of all, add the fish cut into convenient
slices rather small, and let cook until done, but not long
enough so that the fish becomes disintegrated. Remember
there ought to be no violent boiling.</p>

<p>Before serving strain off most of the liquor and serve
it first as soup with a slice of toast in the bottom of the
plate. If the toast has been fried in advance in good
butter, so much the better, but this is not necessary. Then
eat all the solid part except the shells and sop up all the
remaining gravy with bread, using your fingers to do the
job and not a fork. Don’t leave a bit of it.</p>

<p>There ought to be enough of this stew for four people,
but I can usually manage the whole thing myself with
only the slightest assistance from my wife. Wine ought to
be drunk with the meal, a good Burgundy Beaune or
Chambertin. Later one should eat an artichoke cold
vinaigrette, then some fruit and cheese and two small cups
of well made black coffee. After this it is necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
smoke a Corona Corona not too mild, and drink a small
glass of Cointreau Sec. The bread ought to be <i>Pain
Riche</i> in flutes. The fruit may be fresh apricots, a few
green almonds and perhaps some green gages.</p>

<p>The coffee ought to be drunk and the cigar smoked
in the garden which must be in the vicinity of Mount
Boron on the Grande Corniche or it may be in the Parc
Imperial. God ought to be thanked either during or
after the meal, and when it becomes a little too cold in the
garden a fire should be built in the small living room and
one should read Somerville &amp; Ross’ <i>Recollections of an
Irish R. M.</i>, or Neil Lyon’s <i>Simple Simon</i>, or Belloc’s
<i>Path to Rome</i>, or Richard Ford’s <i>Gatherings from Spain</i>
until bedtime.</p>

<p>Repeat the whole process on the following Friday.</p>

<p>God! How hungry I am.</p>

<p>One quart can of tomatoes. Put in kettle on top of
stove, simmer or let boil slowly for one and a half hours.
Add pepper, salt, two onions cut in fine slices, four allspice
and four cloves. The cloves and allspice to be
added after it starts to boil. After two and a half hours
add:</p>

<p>Two pounds chopped beef; add one onion, chopped fine,
two cups bread crumbs, a little parsley, salt and pepper.
Make into meat balls about the size of a plum. Put into
sauce and boil one and one-half hours slowly. This makes
fully three hours’ slow boiling for the sauce. </p>


<h3>SPAGHETTI</h3>

<p>Use a package or a pound of spaghetti; not macaroni.
Have a large pot of boiling water with about one tablespoonful
of salt. Slide the spaghetti into the water.
Do not break it. Boil exactly twenty minutes. Must be
tender, not tough nor doughy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHICKEN PILAU</h3>

<p class='center'><i>“Get a fat hen—the fatter the better.”</i></p>

<p>Because this recipe comes from a Southern cook, there
are no accurate measurements.</p>

<p>Sam would always recommend a “fat hen”—“the fatter
the better,” and “’nough rice and plenty of pepper.”</p>

<p>This I know: The chicken is cut up and boiled in the
water until tender. Should be cooked in a good sized flat
bottom kettle. When the chicken is tender there should
be enough of the stock to come up well around it, but
not to cover it. Then put in with the chicken about a
scant pint of well washed rice. This should be stirred
ONCE, Sam says, and allowed to steam slowly an hour.
Use plenty of pepper to season and salt to taste. Each
grain of rice should be fat and juicy. Successfully made
it is delicious.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—The Chicken Pilau recommended by Mr.
Hays is delicious. A variation perhaps equally good, may
be had by substituting broken spaghetti, or vermicelli for
the rice.</p></div>

<h3>RUM-TUM-TIDDY</h3>

<p class='center'>
“——<i>has the best Welsh rabbit backed off the stove.</i>”<br />
</p>

<p>Take one country home in New Jersey. One dependable
apple-jack bootlegger. One cook who threatens to
leave unless she can begin her nightly visits to her daughter
in the village as early as seven-thirty o’clock.</p>

<p>Take three or four acquaintances who drop in for apple-jack
cocktails just as your cook is about to put the steak
on to broil. Then have your guests linger near the cocktail
shaker until you, your wife and especially your delayed
cook are approaching hysteria.</p>

<p>“Why not stay,” you now announce to your guests in
desperation, “and we’ll all make a rum-tum-tiddy?”</p>

<p>You now tell your grateful cook not to bother preparing
a meal. You next take one flivver and hurriedly drive
her to her daughter’s in the village. Then you buy in
the village one and one-half pounds of American cheese,
one can of Campbell’s Tomato Soup and a dozen bottles
of beer—real beer, if you can get it, Volstead beer if you
can’t.</p>

<p><i>NOW</i>:—</p>

<p>Pry your guests away from the cocktail shaker and shoo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
them into the kitchen. Everybody from this on who is
not occupied in mincing the green pepper in a chopping
bowl is busy cutting the American cheese into cubes about
an inch square. Everybody else beats two fresh eggs—whites
and yolks together.</p>

<p>Drop a lump of butter into a saucepan to prevent
“sticking.” Begin to melt the pound and one half of
diced cheese in the saucepan, stirring the lumps to prevent
burning. When the cheese is fairly well melted, pour
into it the can of tomato soup and the two beaten eggs.
Stir into the mixture about one-third of a bottle of beer.
Pour in also the finely chopped green pepper and continue
stirring until smooth.</p>

<p>Have hot dinner plates ready, each plate containing a
large slice of hot, unbuttered toast. Place at least one
bottle of beer—two if it’s real—beside each plate.</p>

<p>Holler “Ready, people!” and pour on each piece of
toast enough of the contents of the saucepan to form a
pinkish overflow of rum-tum-tiddy on the plate.</p>

<p>That’s all—except to shake ’em up a semi-final cocktail
and then start right back to the village in the flivver
for another pound and one half of cheese, another pepper
and more beer to make another immediately when the first
rum-tum-tiddy is gone. One calls for two, often three.</p>

<p>Serve preferably in the kitchen. Serve in any room far
from the kitchen if you want leg work exercise. Eat until
gorged.</p>

<h3>MINCE-PIE</h3>

<p class='center'>
“<i>Made any other way it’s not mince-pie.</i>”<br />
</p>

<p>My favorite dish, and the best food in the world, is King
Canute Pudding, but I shall not tell anybody how to
make it, because that is a family secret. I am descended
from Canute, and this was the pudding he ate and which
made him feel so good that he went out and bade the tide
to cease rising. The recipe is handed down in each
generation of my tribe. It was my paternal grandmother
who had it to pass on. She lived to be ninety-nine, thanks
to her own wonderful cooking and a cantankerous disposition.
Her mince-pie was a thing to write sonnets
about. It was the second best food in the world. For
ten years after I went to New York I lived on the memory
of that pie and shuddered at the horrendous messes
masquerading under the same name which were offered
to me.</p>

<p>Then I moved back to New England and achieved a
cook who, by the grace of God and the right bringing
up could make a pie like it. For six years I knew happiness
again. Then we lost Kate, the incomparable. My
only hope was my wife and that was a feeble hope, indeed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
She was born not in the pie belt, but in New York.
She had never cooked. She was an Episcopalian. I approached
the next Thanksgiving breakfast with gloomy
forebodings.</p>

<p>But lo, a miracle. It was an orthodox mince-pie. It
was Katie’s mince-pie. It was grandmother’s mince-pie—in
short, it was mince-pie. Here is the way to make it.
Made any other way it’s not mince-pie. </p>


<h4><i>The Filling</i></h4>

<p>Affix the grinder firmly to the edge of the table. What
the palette is to the artist so is the grinder to the creator
of mince meat. Then pass the following ingredients
through the grinder, and from thence into a large kettle
and let the latter and its glorious contents simmer on the
stove for the best part of a morning, stirring them frequently
so that no portion shall be neglected and fail to
come into close union with the soothing heat that mellows
all into one fragrant whole. Take from the stove and
store in stone crocks or glass jars in the dark, and keep
tightly covered. When about to fashion a pie take out
as much of the meat as you desire, wet it with boiled
cider and with fresh cider, too, if possible, so that it is
not stiff, and bake between the crusts whose ingredients
are given below. Eat hot with soft dairy cheese and
coffee.</p>

<p>The meat should be thoroughly boiled the day before
the mince meat is made, and the cider should be boiled
down at home—not bought—until it is the consistency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
molasses. Boil enough to last all winter and put in glass
jars. Now, alas, that no liquors may be had, it is well to
bottle fresh cider and put it away where it is cool, so
that with luck it may still be fresh when in March you
scrape the last jar for the last pie. Only use care when
it is opened, or perchance it will be the ceiling rather
than the pie which will be wet down.</p>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 cups cooked beef; after grinding</li>
<li>2½ cups suet</li>
<li>7½ cups apples</li>
<li>3 cups cider</li>
<li>½ cup vinegar</li>
<li>1 cup molasses</li>
<li>5 cups sugar</li>
<li>¾ pound citron</li>
<li>2½ pounds raisins</li>
<li>1½ pounds small raisins (not to be put through grinder)</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: .5em;">salt to taste</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: .5em;">juice and rind of 2 lemons</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: .5em;">juice and rind of 2 oranges</span></li>
<li>1 tablespoon mace and nutmeg (or 2 nutmegs grated)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons each of cinnamon, cloves and allspice</li>
<li>2 tablespoons  lemon extract</li>
<li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li>
<li>3 cups liquor in which beef was cooked</li></ul>



<p>If you have wine or brandy put in a cupful after taking
from the fire. </p>


<h4><i>The Crust</i></h4>

<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>2 cups pastry flour sifted with teaspoon salt.</li>
<li>½ cup (generous) of lard mixed in with fingertips till the combination is fine and powdery.</li>
</ul>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<p>Wet with cold water, mixing with knife, and cutting,
till you can take the dough from the bowl without sticking
to it. Divide in half, pat gently on floured marble slab,
and roll out thin. Lift lower crust carefully, place in tin
and trim off edges. Roll out from trimmings a strip half
an inch wide and place on top of lower crust, around edge,
first wetting edge slightly with cold water. Put in filling,
place upper crust on top, first wetting edge of rim slightly
with cold water, press together with tines of fork and
trim off overhanging of upper crust. Prick a large T. M.
on the top crust and bake in hot oven till brown.</p>

<p>(The T. M. stands for “’Tis Mince” to distinguish it
from the pies labeled T. M. for “’Tain’t Mince.”)</p>

<h3>POLISH SPECIALTIES</h3>

<p>In following my Polish recipes you will find a practical
use for the geometry of your school days. If you
have forgotten the axioms of Euclid, take a correspondence
course before attempting “Ushka.”</p>

<p>It is simple when you finally master it—and marvelously
good. Don’t forget the line B D. Everything
hinges on that. </p>


<h3>BARSHCK WITH USHKA</h3>

<h4><i>Barshck. (Or Polish Beet Soup)</i></h4>

<p>If you are brave, put three large beets, peeled and quartered
into a glass jar and pour on them a quart of water,
add a teaspoonful of salt and a slice of rye bread. Keep
this in a warm place for about five days. There will
form a sour red-wine-like juice with a whitish mold skin
on the top. Don’t lose your courage, take this skin off
and pour off the juice.</p>

<p>Then prepare a quart of beef, pork and vegetable stock
and while it is hot add to it all your beet juice and a
bottle of cream which you previously have beaten with a
teaspoonful of flour. Heat and stir it all just to boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
point, but do not let it boil, and serve with or without
“Ushka” which are fully described in the next paragraph.</p>


<h4><i>Ushka</i></h4>

<p>Barshck is really not complete without “Ushka,” and
as they are a very simple dish to prepare you should never
omit them.</p>

<p>To make “Ushka” prepare first a fine hash of half a
pound of boiled pork and beef with one small onion, a
tablespoonful of flour, salt and pepper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/i114.jpg" width="420" height="380" alt="Fig. 1" />
</div>

<p>Make white sauce of butter and flour and a little water,
mix this with your hash, let it stew for a while, then add
one raw egg and stir it madly.</p>

<p>Now mix a dough, using half a quart of flour, one
egg, two tablespoonfuls of water, half a teaspoonful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
salt, and butter of the size of a walnut. Knead this vigorously
for half an hour, or until it is quite smooth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/i115a.jpg" width="353" height="346" alt="Fig. 2" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 218px;">
<img src="images/i115b.jpg" width="218" height="236" alt="Fig. 3" />
</div>

<p>Roll the dough out into a sheet 1/8 of an inch thick
and cut it into 2½ inch squares. Put on each dough
square a teaspoonful of your hash; fold them diagonally
along the line BD (Fig. 1) and press the edges together,
thus joining the edge AB unto the edge CB and AD<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
unto CD. You will thus obtain the right angle triangle
ABD (Fig. 2) with the hash inside. Now curve this
triangle along the hypotenuse BD until the 45 degree
corner D meets the 45 degree corner B. Let these two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
corners overlap a little and press them together until they
stick. The shape resulting from this operation resembles
a pig’s ear, as depicted in Figure 3.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 138px;">
<img src="images/i116.jpg" width="138" height="346" alt="1/3 size of the beets" />
</div>

<p>Now put these <i>pig’s ears</i> or <i>Ushka</i> into boiling water;
they will sink, but that should not distress you. Leave
them there until they come to the surface. Put the Ushka
on a platter and pour on them brown butter with crumbs
and serve them as a side dish with <i>barshck</i>. </p>


<h3>BURACHKI</h3>

<p class='center'>(<i>Beets à la Polonaise</i>)</p>

<p>Boil eight little beets, skin them and chop them (not
too fine).</p>

<p>Take one level tablespoonful of butter, and one tablespoonful
of flour. Brown it until it is of a golden hue.
Stir into this half a cupful of vinegar, two tablespoonsful
of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper.
Bring it to boiling, then mix this with your beets.</p>

<p>This sauce for spaghetti is a real Italian mixture—and
wonderful. This is how I learned to make it in
Italy:</p>

<p>Place in a cup or bowl a half teacup full of <i>dried</i>
mushrooms. Pour boiling water over them and just let
them stand until thoroughly softened, say—about a half
hour.</p>

<p>In the meantime cover the bottom of your frying pan
or skillet with butter or olive oil (I prefer the butter).
Chop one big onion and cook slowly, stirring frequently.
In another pan or kettle place two cans of tomatoes. Stew
them for half an hour. Then make three small cakes
of Hamburg steak or chopped beef and put them in to cook,
with the onions. Cook thoroughly. Add at the same
time the mushrooms which have been softened and chopped
into fine particles.</p>

<p>When the meat is cooked through mash the cakes up
with a fork—mixing well with onions and mushrooms.</p>

<p>Now add the stewed tomatoes and, in doing this, press
them through a sieve or colander. Stir well.</p>

<p>Place on back of stove and let steep for one hour after
adding two teaspoons of Eagle Chili Powder (if available)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
or two teaspoons of Lea &amp; Perrins sauce with five dissolved
cubes of beef or chicken bouillon.</p>

<p>To cook the spaghetti, place it, unbroken, in well salted
boiling water. Put it in end first. Boil exactly twenty-three
minutes. Drain. Hold under cold water tap for
a second or two and drain again. Keep warm on stove
until served. This cold water treatment is important.
It removes all gumminess and leaves the spaghetti in
perfect condition. Use the imported spaghetti if available.</p>


<h3>EGGS À LA SALISBURY</h3>

<p>Here is a dish that is easy to make and delicious.</p>

<p>I poach the desired number of eggs until they are just
solid. Then I place them on hot, crisp toast, covering
the eggs with beautifully done bacon.</p>

<p>Over the lot, I pour hot cream until the eggs are
floating.</p>

<p>Salt, pepper and paprika to taste.</p>

<p>Try this for breakfast. </p>


<h3>FISH À LA COMMODORE</h3>

<p>Say you are cooking a six pound bass or some similar
fish—do it this way for a change:</p>

<p>Rub the fish well with salt and pepper. Don’t be afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to rub. Then open the flesh in three places and insert in
each opening a clove of garlic.</p>

<p>Next slice six large onions—six small green peppers—and
six large tomatoes. Now take your Dutch oven or
baking pan and cover the bottom with Mazola oil or olive
oil—add a tablespoon of butter.</p>

<p>When this is <i>hot</i> put in your fish and cover the fish
with the sliced vegetables. Salt and pepper the vegetables.</p>

<p>Cook until the vegetables are done or about one hour.
Baste frequently to avoid scorching the vegetables. To the
basting add two teaspoons of Lea &amp; Perrins sauce and one-half
wine glass of cooking Sherry when half done.</p>

<p>When serving put plenty of juice and sauce on each
portion and make them come back for more. This recipe
can be used for many kinds of large fish. </p>


<h3>TO COOK TROUT</h3>

<p>Dip trout in beaten egg, salt and pepper. Roll in flour
and drop into very hot and very deep Mazola oil. Remove
when golden brown. The trout will be perfectly
free from oil and every bit of the delicate trout flavor will
be sealed up inside. Try it! </p>


<h3>VENISON STEAK</h3>

<p>Venison steak is fairly poor steak at best. But there
is one way to cook it that makes you forget all past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
experiences with venison. And remember this is really
the only way to cook it that’s worth a damn.</p>

<p>Take the venison and strip out <i>all of the white sinews</i>
that lay between the muscles or lean parts. Strip and cut
this white part all away. Then cut your venison into
small strips about the thickness of a finger. Now you are
on your way. Beat up an egg or two and beat in a bit
of salt and pepper. Dip your strips of venison in the
egg, then roll them in flour. Fry in butter and serve
immediately.</p>

<p>Every hunter or guide who has tried this sticks to it.
It’s the one way to cook venison. </p>


<h3>GOOSE</h3>

<p>There is only one way for a man, or any one else, to
cook a goose. Listen: Never pick a goose! Just pull the
skin right off—every inch of it.</p>

<p>Then take a sharp knife and follow down the breast
bone on both sides. Strip the breast meat clear away
from both sides. Split each side of breast into two thin
steaks (if large goose).</p>

<p>Dip these steaks in beaten egg, salt and pepper. Roll
in flour and fry over a medium fire. That’s new to most
folks for goose and it’s going to give you a new idea about
geese when you try it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> </p>


<h3>A MAYONNAISE AND A SALAD DRESSING</h3>

<p>Take yolks of two eggs, beat well and add slowly (drop
at a time) olive oil. If your mixture is too thick lighten
with dash of lemon or vinegar.</p>

<p>Now into a half pint of this mayonnaise put three tablespoons
of Chili sauce; three tablespoons of Blue Label
Ketchup; one tablespoon of finely chopped pimento; one
tablespoon of finely chopped blanched sweet peppers.</p>

<p>To this add one-half teaspoon of salt—pepper and Hungarian
paprika to taste.</p>

<p>Then add, slowly, Tarragon vinegar to taste—say about
one and one-half tablespoons.</p>

<p>Serve this on shrimps, lobster, lettuce or tomato salad. </p>


<h3>DUCKS AND LARGE FOWL</h3>

<p>Ducks, such as Mallard, Canvasback and Redhead,
should be baked. If you once learn how to bake in a
Dutch Oven you have found the secret of successful camp
cookery.</p>

<p>Take a Mallard, for instance. Rub it with salt and
pepper (I might add here: pick ’em dry and keep ’em
dry—no water near a duck!), then put an onion well
up in the body cavity. Fill the remaining space with
celery, wild or domestic.</p>

<p>Get your oven, or Dutch oven, very hot before the
duck goes in. Use no grease and no water—just your dry
pan or oven. A big Mallard will cook perfectly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
twenty minutes. Do not open oven or take lid from
Dutch oven after starting to cook. Serve with currant
jelly. </p>


<h3>TEAL, PARTRIDGE AND SMALL FOWL</h3>

<p>Pick, without breaking the skin. Cut open the back
and break out flat for grilling or broiling. Broil bone
side to the fire for <i>eight</i> minutes. Souse frequently with
melted butter.</p>

<p>Turn and broil, flesh side to the fire, for <i>four</i> minutes,
using more butter. Salt and pepper thoroughly at time
of turning.</p>

<p>Serve with currant jelly. </p>


<h3>BEANS</h3>

<p>Get a deep pot for beans. A heavy iron one is mighty
good.</p>

<p>Take a half pound of salt pork and cut it into very
small pieces. Fry them until brown.</p>

<p>Clean your beans and soak them for at least two hours—or
more. Then boil the beans for two hours, after
which add the pork and one can of Mexican Chili Sauce.
If this is not available, make your own by frying with
the salt pork: four tomatoes, three onions, two bell peppers
and one red pepper, all chopped.</p>

<p>Now you’ve got your mixture and after it’s all together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
put in six beef bouillon cubes; salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to have enough water in the pot so that
when the beans are done a fine soup may be enjoyed before
the beans are eaten. Altogether three to four hours of
cooking is necessary for the best results with beans. </p>


<h3>ITALIAN RICE</h3>

<p>First, a word about cooking rice. Buy the best head
rice. Wash it thoroughly,—six waters. Drop rice slowly
into well salted, boiling water, and boil for twenty-three
minutes. Drain off three-quarters of water and hold rice
under cold water faucet for a moment; this will leave
each grain firm and perfect. Drain thoroughly.</p>

<p>Now the sauce. Place in your skillet olive oil to cover
the bottom; also tablespoon of butter. Chop one large
Spanish onion. Place it in the skillet and cook slowly.
Stir often.</p>

<p>After ten or fifteen minutes, a piece of white fish (sole
preferred) about the size of your four fingers, from the
palm down—see? When the onions are a golden color
add one finely chopped clove of garlic. When fish is
thoroughly cooked, mash it up with a fork and stir well.
Now add one or two cans of tomatoes which have been
stewing slowly for half an hour or more. Add them
through a sieve and push with a spoon so as to get the
thick part through. Mix well.</p>

<p>Place this on the back of the stove where it will simmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
for one hour. Add a pinch of saffron or thyme—salt and
pepper to taste.</p>

<p>This sauce can be used for only one meal, as it sours
after a few hours. Sauce should be applied by each person
as desired until it’s all gone. </p>


<h3>STEAK SAUCE</h3>

<p>Have a large platter very, very hot—really hot!</p>

<p>Then the minute the steak is done, put it on the platter
and work fast. Over the steak sprinkle a very little bit
of dry English mustard. Then a squeeze or two of lemon.
Now several thin slices of butter, a little Worcestershire
sauce, salt, pepper and paprika. Rub all this in with a
broad knife. Turn steak and repeat the operation. Now
tip platter on edge and quickly whip the sauce into a froth,
using a fork. Serve two or three tablespoons of sauce
with each piece of steak.</p>

<h3>CHICKEN HALIBUT</h3>

<p class='center'>(<i>Baked and with Parmesan</i>)</p>

<p>Boil some slices of halibut in court bouillon, lay in
baking dish a border of potato croquette—either hard or
shaped with hand. Have layer of bechamel on bottom of
dish—then one of shredded fish, another layer of bechamel
and one more of fish, finishing with the bechamel; sprinkle
with bread crumbs and grated Parmesan. Pour over a
little butter and brown in the oven.</p>

<p><i>With Parmesan.</i> Prepare same and make solid paste
by mixing together butter and Parmesan cheese with pinch
paprika. Work well and roll out one-eighth inch thick.
Cover last layer bechamel with this and brown in hot
oven.</p>

<p><i>Bechamel Sauce.</i> Prepare roux of butter and flour, let
cook few minutes while stirring—not allow to color—remove
to slower fire and leave it to cook 15 minutes.
Then dilute gradually with half boiled milk. </p>


<h3>ONION SOUP AU GRATIN</h3>

<p>Cut into small 1/8 inch squares two medium onions,
fry them in butter and add two dessert spoons flour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
moisten with two quarts of broth, adding bunch of parsley
garnished with chervil, bay leaf and clove and garlic.
Season with a little salt, pepper and some meat extract,
boil for 20 minutes—then remove the bouquet—pour the
soup over very thin slices of bread placed in a metal
soup tureen in intervening layers of bread and cheese—Parmesan—finishing
with the Parmesan and sprinkle a
little over the top of the soup. Bake in hot oven or boil
ten minutes and thicken with raw yolks of two eggs diluted
in cream. </p>


<h3>RICE Á LA MANHATTAN</h3>

<p>Chop two onions—fry in butter, add a pound of rice
and beat together. When very hot, add enough broth to
triple quantity—let boil and cook in slack oven for 20
minutes. Add when done, six ounces grated Parmesan.
Pour ⅔ of this into casserole, make hole in center and
fill with shrimps and minced mushrooms; around sides
lay fillet of sole, pour over lean Spanish sauce—reduced
with essence of mushrooms—mix well and cover whole
with remainder of rice—put in hot oven for fifteen minutes
and serve.</p>

<p>Sauce:—1 quart of stock—melt ¼ pound of butter—stir
in same amount of flour—making clear paste—add
stock—brown slowly.</p>

<h3>“SCOLLOPED” OYSTERS</h3>

<p>If I must make a decision, I think I shall have to
vote in favor of escalloped oysters. Back home we call
them “scolloped.” The restaurant and hotel article is
not the real thing. The portions are stingy and the
oysters are heated just enough to render them helpless
and they lie embedded in some dry packing, evidently
meant to be an article of food. Escalloped oysters, as
prepared at home, came in a deep pan which had been
subjected to great heat. The oysters were used with the
greatest prodigality. They were cooked in cracker crumbs
or corn meal and they were cooked until the delicious
flavor of the bivalve had permeated all parts of the dish.
Milk or cream and real country butter had been used
unsparingly, so that the whole compound was moist and
the seasoning had been well distributed, and the whole
result was, in my opinion, a triumph. For some reason,
the real “scolloped” oysters attain their perfection only
when prepared by women past thirty years of age.</p>

<p>I am not undertaking to give the recipe. Probably it
is something secret—beyond the reach or comprehension of
any man, but the dish itself is worthy of all the complimentary
adjectives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—Here is the way to do it—first butter the
bottom and sides of a pan (deep) or baking dish, then cover
the bottom with those little, round, old-fashioned oyster
crackers, all crisp and salty. Next place a layer of oysters,
fresh or cove. If you don’t know what cove oysters are ask
some one who was raised in the Middle West. Now a layer
of crackers crushed; then more oysters and so on until the
pan is full. Season each layer of oysters with salt and
pepper. Put little bits of butter all over the cracker layers.
Now fill the pan with milk and cream to which has been
added a bit of the oyster liquor. Cover the top well with
crushed crackers. Put a cover on the dish or pan and slip it
into the oven. Some folks add a teaspoonful of Worcestershire
sauce to the milk and cream. Bake until the juices
bubble up. Don’t let too much of the moisture bake away.
At the last minute take the cover off the dish and brown the
top.</p>

<p>The richer the cream and butter the better the result.</p>

<p>The dish is even better than Mr. Ade would lead you to
believe, and it <i>can be made</i> by an amateur male cook—that’s
why Mr. Ade’s contribution is printed in spite of the rank
heresy to which he professes.</p></div>

<h3>DEEP APPLE PIE</h3>

<p>Dr. Lyman Abbott’s favorite dish is a Deep Apple Pie,
which is made like the deep fruit tarts so plentiful in
England.</p>

<p>Here is a thoroughly satisfactory way to make Dr.
Abbott’s specialty: Line a deep pie tin with a rich crust,
fill with tart, juicy apples sliced very thin. Sprinkle
sugar and a little cinnamon over them. Scatter bits of
butter over the apples, about a tablespoonful in all. Also
sprinkle with a tablespoonful of water. Use four or five
tablespoonsful of sugar. Cover with top crust and bake
slowly for a half, or perhaps three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>For the real <i>deep dish</i> pie put the apples, sugar and
butter (above proportions) in the individual deep dish
and cover with top crust. Bake the same. The spices
may be varied to taste.</p>

<h3>LETTUCE (à la Red Creek)</h3>

<p>In behalf of my favorite fodder, the tender leafling
lettuce that’s newly sprung in June, I am pleased to present
a method of introducing it to the human system with
a maximum effectiveness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wilted Lettuce</span>:—It is said that this dish comes to
us from the Hessians. If this be treason let us make the
most of it.</p>

<p>Having obtained the lettuce, young and tender and
fresh from the patch, plucked before it is yet headstrong,
toss it into a bucket of cold water to crisp it.</p>

<p>Repairing to the kitchen, place on the hot stove a
skillet and heave into it a good sized cupful of chopped
bacon. Let it fry thoroughly. Add a dessert spoonful
of salt, a pinch of mustard, a couple of tablespoonsful
of granulated sugar and good cider vinegar in quantity
slightly in excess of the bacon fat. Let it simmer smartly
until well blended. Meanwhile lay out the lettuce in
noble heaps on the plates on which it is to be served.
Chop up a handful of green onions, a bit of the tops will
do no harm, and at the last moment stir them into the
concoction in the skillet.</p>

<p>While the whole is sizzling and boiling vigorously, pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the mixture over the lettuce, using a spoon to apportion
the nifty bits of bacon about, and serve forthwith.</p>

<p>By this method one can take aboard amazing quantities
of lettuce, which is most desirable in view of the fact
that this gentle herb contributes strongly to the summer
languor when taken in adequate quantities.</p>

<h3>HASH</h3>

<p>All joking aside, my favorite dish is hash.</p>

<p>I have never actually been in the kitchen to see hash
pass through the various stages of its epicurean development,
but I imagine hash is manufactured something like
this:</p>

<p>First the father must eat a big lunch, the mother must
fill herself up on cake in the afternoon and the children
must have spoiled stomachs. This condition of affairs
ruins the evening meal completely and there is plenty of
meat left over for hash the next day.</p>

<p>The cook takes the beef or veal or whatever it is and
throws it into the electric fan. The flying bits of meat
are caught on ping pong rackets by experts and knocked
back into a pot that contains a large quantity of mashed
potatoes. Then the fire is lighted and the cook can go
out to an afternoon movie.</p>

<p>The beauty of hash is that, no matter how it tastes,
you think it is all right. There is no standard flavor
for hash. Hash is fundamentally accidental, so it has no
traditions to live up to.</p>

<h3>CORN BREAD</h3>

<p>When I was young and sometimes went camping my
favorite dish was corn bread. In those days, we always
began proceedings by building a mud oven. Now I believe
portable ovens are convenient and cheap. In any event,
following is my recipe:</p>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of flour</li>
<li>3 cups of cornmeal</li>
<li>4 heaping teaspoonsful of baking powder</li>
<li>2 eggs well beaten</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 generous pint of milk</li>
<li>2 tablespoonsful of melted crisco or lard</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 3em;">Do not scald the cornmeal.</span></li></ul>



<p>Mix the meal with flour, baking powder, salt and sugar,
beat the eggs until they are light, add the milk and eggs
to the other ingredients. Beat the whole until it is smooth
and light—about one minute. Finally adding the melted
crisco or lard; pack into shallow, greased pan and bake
in a hot oven for twenty-five minutes.</p>

<h3>CHIRIN POLOW</h3>

<p>Necessary materials: One pound of rice (Carolina rice
is most suitable); one spring chicken; the peel of four
oranges; four ounces of sugar; half a pound of salt; two
grams of Spanish saffron; two ounces of almonds; half
a pound of butter.</p>

<p>Method of cooking the rice: If the dish is required
for a luncheon at one o’clock, it will be necessary, the
night before, to rinse the rice three times in water, rubbing
it each time with the palms of the hands. Change
the water each time.</p>

<p>Next soak the rice in tepid water, letting the water
stand three inches over the rice. Pour the half pound of
salt on the rice and let it stand until 11 a. m. of the
next day.</p>

<p>Into a two gallon caldron pour six quarts of water and
let it boil. As soon as it boils pour out slowly and with
care the water in which the rice has been soaking since
the night before. Empty the rice into the boiling water.
Cover the caldron and increase the heat. As soon as the
caldron containing the rice begins to boil remove the cover
and stir the rice gently with a flat spoon. Then replace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the lid and let the contents of the caldron boil again.
Repeat the stirring process three times. Next drain the
rice in a sieve, shaking it to remove all adherents of salt
and starch. Now melt a quarter of a pound of butter
in a large cup of water. Pour half of the melted butter
into a one-gallon caldron and gently empty the rice into
the caldron in such a way that it will spread uniformly
without sticking together in rice balls. Place the caldron
in a hot oven. Close the oven and after five or six minutes
see if the caldron is hot; if it is, bring it out gently
and pour the remainder of the melted butter over the
rice and replace in the oven. Now reduce the heat until
the caldron gives a hollow sound when rapped with the
fingers; this will indicate that the rice is sufficiently cooked.</p>

<p>Preparation of the almonds: Boil the almonds for a
few minutes until the skins fall off and the almonds become
white. Cut the almonds into four quarters perpendicularly.</p>

<p>Preparation of the orange peel: Remove the white part
of the peel to such an extent that both sides of the peel
are of the same color. When this has been done cut the
peel into long thin strings. These should be boiled in
two waters so as to remove all bitterness. Then strain.</p>

<p>Combining the almonds and the orange peel: Mix the
almonds and the orange peel and boil them in a syrup
of sugar for ten minutes. Strain and keep in a warm
place until needed.</p>

<p>Cooking the chicken: Begin boiling the chicken very
slowly at eight o’clock in the morning. Boil to such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
point that the skin and bones detach themselves from the
flesh.</p>

<p>Preparation of the saffron: Warm the saffron to remove
all dampness and pound it to a powder in a mortar;
after which dissolve it in three tablespoonsful of cold
water.</p>

<p>Dishing the Polow: One half of the rice should be
taken from the caldron and mixed in a bowl with the
orange peel and almonds. Over this sprinkle three tablespoonsful
of saffron water to color well. Now pour over
it about two tablespoonsful of melted butter.</p>

<p>Next remove the remainder of the rice from the caldron
and dish it up ready for the table. Place the chicken
from which the skin and bones have been removed on
top of the rice. Crown the whole with the rice, which
has already been mixed with the almonds and orange
peel and colored with the saffron.</p>

<p>This will make a delightful and pleasantly flavored dish—Chirin
Polow, which means “sweet Polow.”</p>

<h3>FRENCH-FRIED ONIONS</h3>

<p>Onions are on my permitted list of foods and they are
prepared for the table in many ways. The best way that
I know of has been given the name of French-fried
onions. I first ate onions in this form at the famous
Grove Park Inn, Asheville, North Carolina, and have
since introduced the dish on dining cars and into many
private homes.</p>

<p>Take a Bermuda onion—any other large onion would
do—cut it into slices through the rings so that each
slice will be made up of a large number of whole rings.
Then break the slices up into separate rings, drop these
into a thin batter and fry them as you fry French-fried
potatoes. Each ring looks like a little doughnut. I find
that the dish is universally praised.</p>

<p>May I add a word in regard to radishes, of which
I am very fond. The long White Icicle radish is, in
my judgment, the best variety and I have found that butter
added to the salt makes the radish a little more palatable.</p>

<h3>HAM AND EGGS</h3>

<p>Take a frying pan and some ham. Cook the ham
in its own fat in the frying pan—cook until the ham is
well dappled with golden brown, or until it is cooked
enough. Then break some eggs. Take out the ham and
put it on a hot platter, then put in the eggs. Baste them
a bit with the hot ham fat. Put a cover on the pan and
let the eggs cook in the hot pan with no fire. A minute or
two will do—then serve the eggs with the ham and—oh,
boy!</p>

<p>For the very best results use the best ham you can get
and plenty of day old eggs.</p>

<h3>SOLE Á LA MARGUERY AND DUCK
WITH ORANGES</h3>

<p>I have two favorite dishes: both being examples of the
French cuisine at its highest.</p>

<p>One is “Sole à la Marguery” (which can be made with
flounder, also) and was originated by old Monsieur
Marguery at his famous restaurant in Paris. It has a
sauce which has a wine base and which contains shrimps
and small oysters. </p>


<h4><i>Sole à la Marguery</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lay your sole in a buttered platter, add about a glassful
of white wine, season and poach:</p>

<p>I. E. Let boil for about fifteen minutes and then take
the juice out, mix with it a yolk of a raw egg, about two
ounces of sweet butter. Beat slowly so as to get it thick,
something like a hollandaise; add a few shrimps, oysters,
mussels, and a few heads of mushrooms, cook the sole with
it, glaze in a salamande two or three minutes and serve.</p></div>

<p>Another is duck cooked with oranges. I know how
to ask for it at the St. Regis and the Brevoort, but am
not sure of the spelling. It sounds like Duck “Bigarade.”
They do it well at the Brevoort. If potatoes are served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
with either of these dishes they should be potatoes gaufrettes—on
a separate plate. </p>


<h4><i>Duck Bigarade</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To Roast: Select a young and very tender duck, prepare
and truss it for roasting. It should be roasted on
the spit or in the oven for fifteen to twenty-five minutes,
according to its size and the heat of the fire.</p>

<p>A domestic duck ought to be served quite rare, and
should be killed without bleeding. Dish it after untrussing
and pour over it a little of its gravy.</p>

<p>Sauce Bigarade: Peel an orange without touching the
white parts, cut the peel up into small, fine julienne.
Plunge it into boiling water, and cook until it is tender.
Drain and enclose it in a covered saucepan with four gills
of espagnole or brown sauce. Just when ready to serve
finish the sauce with a dash of cayenne pepper, meat glaze,
the orange juice and the juice of a lemon, strain through
a tamis, adding two ounces of fine butter.</p></div>

<h3>OMELETTE—AND PIE</h3>

<p>I can give you a tip on how to prepare, in the very
best fashion, two articles of food.</p>

<p>The first is omelette: The frying pan should be held
at a slant, with the lower part immediately over a moderate
heat, and continually the volume of eggs that becomes
cooked should be scraped back and the liquid part
allowed to flow over the pan thus emptied, and then when
the omelette is, I should say, about two-thirds cooked, it
should be removed from the fire and dished.</p>

<p>It is impossible to make an omelette of the utmost
symmetry and firmness and have it good at the same time.
If it is stiff enough to maintain a certain symmetry, then
it is too stiff to be good. I have made an omelette in
this fashion containing as many as eighteen eggs. I
learned how to make omelette from Madame Poulard
of Mont St. Michel in Normandy, one of the most famous
omelette makers in Europe.</p>

<p>I am also particularly successful in making pies. On
one occasion I made pies for one hundred and eighty-five
officers on the troop-ship <i>Leviathan</i>. To make pies, one
must have the best quality of butter and the best quality
of flour. Use a pound of butter to every two pounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of flour. The butter must be rather firm and must be
mixed with the flour with your hands. Then when you
have a sort of a mass of dough on the table, make a
little hollow in the middle, pour in a little cold water,
mix it to such a consistency that it can be made into a
roll perhaps as thick as your wrist. It will require about
two inches to be rolled out thin for the crusts. Dust
a little flour in the dish that it is to be baked in and
put into the oven at such a temperature as would require
one half an hour to bake. There’s a considerable secret
in the choice of fruits. The top crust should have little
apertures in it so as to permit the steam to escape. It
is easier to make perfect pies than any other dish.</p>

<h3>SPAGHETTI-FOR-THE-GANG</h3>

<p>Many a time as a very small boy I watched my distinguished
Piedmontese grandfather grandly direct the cook.
This is the way our spaghetti sauce was prepared. Buy
about three or four pounds of solid meat from the round,
cut thick. Ask for the “eye of the beef.” It is inexpensive.
Cut little pockets in it and insert bits of fat
bacon in some. In others stuff sage, thyme, parsley and
bay leaf with salt and pepper to taste. Sometimes
I spread thinly with mustard, the prepared sort; covering
the top. A clove of garlic tucked in with the seasoning
goes well, if you have Wop ancestry. Pale people use
onions. But surely one or the other.</p>

<p>Grease well a deep iron skillet with iron top, the pot-roast
utensil. When the gravy begins to drip add a little
water, but not much. The steam makes the meat tender
and brings out all the flavors in the little pockets. Baste
from time to time just to get the aroma of the simmering
mess and sharpen your appetite. Take a little wire and
jab it in the roast after about an hour and twenty minutes
and you’ll find out whether it is tender and juicy enough.</p>

<p>Put the big pot on and get your water boiling fast.
Add a good sized kitchen spoon of salt. Better salt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
water to taste. Throw in a pound of Italian made
spaghetti ... the Farina spaghetti. It requires a certain
kind of wheat to make good macaroni. Boil for twenty
minutes. Drain off water.</p>

<p>To the rich gravy you will find the roast swimming
in add a small can of tomato paste, stirring in slowly.
As this is poured over the spaghetti add grated Roman
cheese. You will get it all properly dressed by using two
forks, lifting and dropping the strands. Serve piping hot
with an automatic revolver at hand so that the man who
cuts his can be disposed of promptly. Some twine the
spaghetti about the fork. Others just lead a mass of it
to the face and bite off what they want at that particular
mastication.</p>

<p>A good salad and Italian bread, to be secured at any
small dealer’s where the boss sings <i>Santa Lucia</i> in a thin
high voice as he slices the salami, goes well with the roast.
This layout will last an old bachelor or a deserted husband
two or three days. It’s grand when it’s warmed up in a
boiler.</p>

<h3>VEAU SAUTÉ MARENGO</h3>

fond of two dishes and they still remain my favorites:</p>

<p>No. 1—Veau Sauté Marengo—nothing epicurean about
this, but real tasty; a ragout of veal which must be
served in a brown pot. It is flavored with tiny onions
and mushrooms, olives and a delicious sauce. I have never
found it quite so well prepared as in Paris.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fry some small pieces of veal in oil, add one chopped
onion, one head of crushed garlic and when it is well
brown strain it, add one glass of white wine and reduce.
Moisten it with one quart of brown sauce. Add two
pounds fresh tomatoes and some fine herbs. Cook slowly
for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Put the meat in another pan, add few small onions
cooked in butter, some small mushrooms already cooked.</p>

<p>Dress and serve on toast fried in butter.</p></div>

<p>No. 2—Vol au Vent Financière—a pastry form filled
with mushrooms, cubes of chicken, something else, and a
good sauce. This also seems not quite the same outside
of Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> </p>

of cooked sweetbread cut in three-sixteenth inch squares,
small bits of the white of chicken, some truffles, olives,

<p>Moisten with one pint of Madeira sauce, let boil and
despumate; when the sauce is done strain it through a

<h3>BOILED BEEF AND HORSERADISH SAUCE</h3>

<p>I love boiled beef and horseradish sauce—I love it
better than any other dish in the world!</p>

<p>Anybody knows how to boil beef. And a good horseradish
sauce is made in this fashion.</p>

<p>Melt a good sized lump of the best butter—almost as
big as an egg, is good sized. Add to this, first removing
from the fire, about two tablespoonsful of flour. Stir the
flour and butter together until the mixture is absolutely
smooth, and then add cold milk—a trifle more than a half
pint, a shade less than a pint. Put over a slow fire in a
sauce pan or, for safety’s sake, a double-boiler. Cook
slowly until the sauce is of the desired consistency, and
then add your horseradish. If you like the sauce very
hot add a lot of horseradish. If you like it moderate, a
little horseradish. The best way is to begin with a teaspoonful
and keep adding and tasting until it’s O. K.
Salt and pepper to taste, of course. And, if you like it,
a dash of celery salt.</p>

<h3>STUFFED CELERY</h3>

<p>I like food. I like almost any kind of food. I’ve
eaten all varieties—in great cities and in out of the way
corners of the world. And I’ve never found anything
that I couldn’t eat, if I were hungry enough!</p>

<p>But best of all I think that I like stuffed celery. It’s
easy to fix, and it’s slightly out of the ordinary, and it’s
possible to consume a lot of it without being looked down
upon by those who are dining with you. Because everybody
eats a lot of stuffed celery.</p>

<p>To a half pound of Roquefort cheese add a quarter of
a pound of butter. Cream them together until they are
as smooth as it is possible to make any mixture containing
Roquefort cheese. Then add a dessertspoonful—or a
tablespoonful, if you like—of Worcestershire sauce. A
little salt, and some paprika, enough to slightly color the
mixture. And then—</p>

<p>Take stalks of celery—very white and crisp and fresh.
And stuff the hollow side, until it bulges, with the
Roquefort mixture. And serve with your dinner, or
after dinner, or with the salad, or all alone. It doesn’t
matter when or where you place it on the menu, for it’s
apt to be the dominant note!</p>

<h3>ORANGE COMPOTE</h3>

<p>Orange Compote is my favorite dish. After my fourth
I begin to forget that I’m a human being. After my
sixth I can feel myself drifting into a blissfully comatose
state—with only strength enough left to call for a seventh.</p>

<p>Orange Compote, at its best, may be obtained in any
small Turkish or Armenian restaurant where the coffee
is good and the dishes aren’t too offensively clean. When
made at home it is never quite the same—I don’t know
why. This, however, is the best working substitute that
I am able to concoct.</p>

<p>Take as many oranges as your system is capable of
absorbing, and peel them, removing all of the thin white
inside skin, and all of the film-like tissue that divides an
orange into sections. I forgot to mention that the orange
should be large, luscious, juicy and free of seeds. Place
the oranges in individual serving dishes and pour over them
this sauce, while hot:</p>

<p>For about six oranges you will need one middle-sized
jar of orange marmalade and one small can of Hawaiian
pineapple. Put the marmalade, the pineapple—cut into
small cubes—and the pineapple juice into a double boiler
and cook, briskly, until the liquid begins to thicken. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
pour it over the uncooked oranges and allow them—each
in its individual dish—to stand in the ice box until
dessert time. Just before serving, sprinkle with a few
pine nuts, or salted almonds. Pine nuts are best.</p>

<h3>A FAVORITE MENU</h3>

<p>I can hardly say that I have a “favorite dish.” But
a favorite menu for luncheon or dinner is clam soup,
corned beef hash, and baked Indian pudding.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Note.</i>—If you want to try Dr. Eliot’s menu why not
use Rex Beach’s clam specialty?</p>

<p>Then for the corned beef hash get plenty of fine lean
corned beef and cut it into one-eighth inch bits.</p>

<p>Chop one small onion into very fine particles. Take
cold boiled potatoes (fairly firm) and cut or chop.</p>

<p>Prepare some drawn butter and add a few drops of
Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Now mix the meat,
potatoes, onion and drawn butter. Mold and pat into
small, flat, elliptical loaves (individual servings) and fry
in a hot, lightly buttered pan. Turn frequently until
well browned on both sides. Serve sprinkled with minced
parsley.</p>

<p>Top off with this baked Indian pudding:</p>

<p>You must have 1 quart of milk, 3 eggs, ½ cup of
the finest seeded raisins, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 2 heaping
tablespoonsful of corn meal, 4 heaping tablespoonsful of
sugar, 1 heaping tablespoonful of butter.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil the milk in a double boiler and sprinkle in the
corn meal, stirring all the time. Cook twelve minutes.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs, adding the salt, sugar and a half teaspoonful
of ground ginger. Add this mixture with the
butter to milk and meal, then add the raisins and stir
until perfectly mixed. Remove from the double boiler
and bake for one hour.</p>

<h3>COCOA CREAM CAKE</h3>

cake! And my own dear mother will have to stand the
responsibility for whatever shame comes to me by openly
declaring it. You see, she makes it. And it was from
her I learned the secret of its concoction.</p>

<p>Here is the recipe:</p>

<p>Four eggs, one cup of sugar, one cup of cocoa, a teaspoonful
of vanilla, and a teaspoonful of baking powder.
Cream yolks of eggs and sugar <i>well</i>; add the vanilla.
Sift the cocoa and baking powder well, and add to the
eggs and sugar. Last of all stir in the whites of the eggs,
beaten. Bake in two layers, for about ten minutes.
When cold whip a pint of thick cream with a teaspoonful
of vanilla and sugar to taste—placing half between the
layers and half on top.</p>

<h3>SQUAB EN CASSEROLE</h3>

<p>In a casserole put generous layer of sliced onion sauté,
two sliced tomatoes sauté, two cups of mushrooms, two
cups of potato balls, and a little fresh parsley also sauté.
(All the vegetables should be fried in butter). On top
place, breast up, a squab or a one-pound chicken—one for
each person. On each breast place a slice of crisp fried
bacon. Over all pour some rich well-seasoned brown
sauce, filling the casserole up with the chicken breasts—three-quarters
full—preferably with a cup of sherry added
last, if your cellar will still produce it!</p>

<p>Place the casserole in a hot oven, uncovered. When the
breasts are brown, cool oven to a moderate heat, cover
the casserole and cook for two hours. Then remove the
casserole and serve from dish.</p>

<h3>SPICED GRAPES</h3>

<p>This dish is always reminiscent, to me, of low New
England farmhouses, with green blinds. You know the
kind—set far back from the road, among tall trees, with
hollyhocks, and rose geraniums and old fashioned pinks
in the garden. When I see such a house—and I can,
sometimes, by closing my eyes—I can always smell the
pungent scent of spiced grapes, cooking away on an immaculate
kitchen range.</p>

<p>This is the rule for making spiced grapes. A rule that
most New England families seem to follow.</p>

<p>To seven pounds of grapes there should be added
these materials—three pounds of granulated sugar, one
cup of vinegar, two tablespoonsful of ground cinnamon,
and one tablespoonful of ground cloves.</p>

<p>Weigh the grapes, wash and pulp them. Cook the pulp
until the seeds are loosened—then press the mass through
a sieve. Cook the skins just as long as you cook the
pulps. Put them on the same stove, but in separate
kettles. Add the strained pulps to the skins, then vinegar,
sugar, and spices. And cook until the mixture thickens.</p>

<p>This, when served with cold meat, changes a commonplace
supper of left-overs into a feast.</p>

<h3>TRIPE Á LA MODE DE CAEN Á LA ROY
CARRUTHERS</h3>

<p>Only an artist should attempt to make Tripe à la
Mode de Caen because only an artist can make it. It
requires the soul of a poet, the spirit of a painter, and
the exaltation of a violin virtuoso in the maker as a prerequisite
for its concoction. Of course, it may be eaten
by the commonalty, but it is too good for them. It really
is a dish for the intelligentsia.</p>

<p>There are not more than a dozen people in the United
States who have the temperament and the touch required.
One of these is Roy Carruthers. And herewith, as my
favorite recipe, I set down the complicated but necessary,
procedure for producing this work of art:</p>

<p>Take four pounds of fresh honeycomb tripe and one
pound of fresh manyplies tripe (the thickest part) and
wash thoroughly in many changes of fresh water. Drain
well, and scrape to have all absolutely clean. Take two
calf’s feet and carefully bone each foot and cut into pieces
two inches square. Have a large earthen pot, scrupulously
clean, and line sides and bottom of this pot with very
thin slices of larding pork. Place tripe and cut up feet
in pot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Add two small red carrots, two white onions with two
cloves stuck in each, and half of a sound, seeded pepper.
Make a bouquet of two leeks, two branches of celery, three
branches of parsley, and a sprig of thyme, marjoram, a
blade of mace and a bay leaf—only one. Put this bouquet
in the pot and pour in a half pint of white wine, a pint
of cider and a quart of consomme or white broth. Season
with a full teaspoon of salt and half a spoon of black
pepper.</p>

<p>Now make a stiff dough with a pound of white flour
and two gills of water, roll out on a table until you have
enough to cover the pot, and cover closely, making sure
there can be no evaporation.</p>

<p>Place pot in a very slow oven and cook for fifteen hours.</p>

<p>Then lift up the cover, skim off the fat, and remove
the bouquet of herbs and the vegetables.</p>

<p>Chop together six shallots, or scallions if shallots are
not procurable, the red part of a carrot, a bean of sound
garlic, two ounces of raw ham and an ounce of raw lean
pork. Place this hash in a saucepan with a tablespoon
of melted butter, cook gently on the fire for five minutes,
stirring lightly, and then pour in half a gill of cognac and
let it reduce briskly until it is nearly dry.</p>

<p>Put the contents of the pot on the saucepan, add a gill
of pure tomato juice, mix lightly with a wooden spoon,
and cook slowly for forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Then dress the tripe on a deep hot dish, sprinkle a little
freshly chopped parsley over and send to table very hot
with twelve slices of toasted French bread.</p>

<p>That is real Tripe à la mode de Caen. All others are
imitations.</p>

<h3>CLAM CHOWDER</h3>

<p>Try out salt pork. Take out the scraps. Cut up onions
and fry them in the pork fat until they are a golden brown.
Open clams and save all the clam water. (Most chefs
steam the clams first because they are so much easier to
handle, but if you want the real flavor you want to shell
the clams, wash the meat over carefully and let the clam
water settle and dip it out instead of pouring it into your
kettle so as to leave out the sand.)</p>

<p>Add to the onions enough hot water to cover them, put
in clam water and the bellies of the clams. Cook until
the bellies of the clams have practically disappeared (about
two hours). Then add whatever more hot water is necessary,
add the rest of your clam meat, after having first
cut off the black end of the head, and run the meat
through the coarsest cutting disk of your meat grinder.
Cook until clams are very nearly done and then add your
sliced white potato. Cook again until the potatoes are
done. Then add whatever milk you put in and let it
come to a boil. Put into the chowder what we call
Boston cracker. They are shaped like a water cracker
only they are soft. Split them in halves. These will
soften up immediately and you can then serve your
chowder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not use any flour for thickening. If the chowder
is prepared and the bellies of the clams cooked as above,
this will make the broth thicken up.</p>

<h3>BAKED BEANS</h3>

<p class='center'>(<i>My Favorite Dish</i>)</p>

<p>To prepare Mr. Curtis’ favorite food is no difficult
task and any number of methods original and otherwise
may be followed.</p>

<p>For the best results have a large covered bean pot and
the rest is easy.</p>

<p>Select fine white or navy beans. Wash them thoroughly
and let them soak in clear water for several hours—most
folks soak them all night.</p>

<p>Place the beans in the pot with several pieces of salt
pork (with fat), cover with water slightly salted. Put
the lid on the pot and bake in a moderate oven until done.
That’s plain baked beans.</p>

<p>Chili sauce or tomato catsup or chopped tomatoes may
be added to taste.</p>

<p>Look at the beans occasionally and add water if they
seem too dry or in danger of burning.</p>

<p>Another method which produces wonderful results is
to omit the pork and tomato preparations and add generous
lumps of butter and brown sugar—better still, add

be extra careful to see that <i>just enough water</i> is added
in small quantities to prevent burning.</p>

<p>Always remove from the oven while the beans are

of the oven and the length of time the beans were soaked.</p>

<h3>SPAGHETTI DIABOLIQUE</h3>

<p>Brown one and a half pounds top plate of beef in half
a cup of boiling olive oil for one hour, turning frequently.
Mince the shells of four sweet peppers, one bunch of
celery, one bunch of parsley, three large onions, two sections
of clove garlic, add a salt-spoonful of ground thyme,
a teaspoonful of salt, one of black pepper and red pepper
to taste. Add one quart of tomatoes, pour over the beef,
cook for an hour, add a pint of water and cook slowly
for two hours more.</p>

<p>To make the spaghetti: Measure a quart of flour, break
in yolks of three eggs, add three half eggshells full of
ice water, work to the proper consistency, roll and cut into
thin strips. When dry cook in boiling salted water for
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Place spaghetti in the center of a dish, pour the sauce
and shredded meat around it, and serve.</p>

<h3>FISH CHOWDER</h3>

<p>I will say that I like to cook (and if I have good
luck, to eat) a dish for which the following is the recipe:</p>

<p>First catch your fish with hook and line,—salmon, trout
or bass, cod, haddock or blue-fish. Then obtain a good
sized kettle and put into it, first a layer of sliced potatoes,
then a fine sprinkling of fine sliced onion, then a layer
of fat pork cut into small cubes, then a layer of fish,
skinned and sliced, then a layer of crackers or thin pilot
biscuit. Sprinkle salt and pepper on each layer according
to taste. Repeat the layers from three to five times
according to the size of your kettle. Fill the pot moderately
full with water and put it on the fire to cook
slowly. If the water gets low replenish it. You can
tell when the dish is done by testing the potatoes or the
fish with a fork. As a rule it should take about an hour
to cook. Just before the end put in two or three cupfuls
of milk. If your taste is slightly vitiated by contact with
the world you may add a double spoonful of some spicy
sauce. But for my part I like a chowder best <i>au naturel</i>.</p>

<p>Then, the frying pan—</p>

<p>About one-half dozen thin slices of the best bacon.

<p>Onions fried golden brown.</p>

<p>Then to the onions add a can of tomatoes or the equivalent
of sliced tomatoes.</p>

<p>Keep stirring from the bottom to prevent burning.</p>

<p>All must cook until it has thickened.</p>

<p>While cooking add chili peppers cut fine, green peppers

<p>Add one or two large bay leaves and season to taste
with salt and pepper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>About ten minutes before the Gumbo is ready add—</p>

<p>One can of Golden Bantam Corn.</p>

<p>To serve with the Gumbo have a dish of perfectly

<h3>MORELS SAUTÉ</h3>

<p>There is a dish—a gastronomical ecstasy—the faintest
conception of which is magnificently beyond the pen. The
fork is the one utensil that can convey to the uninitiated
the unique, the utterly sublime flavor of Morels sauté.</p>

<p>A Morel is—in the vernacular of the countryside—a
sponge mushroom. It is to be found in ancient, unplowed
orchards during the pastel phase of spring when apple
trees blossom and bees zoom and bumble and hum in a
languid shower of pink and white petals.</p>

<p>Close to a girthy apple tree, scabrous with age, pock-marked
by the bills of countless woodpeckers, the Morels,
now and then—alas, it is only now and then—poke up
through the cold, damp, chocolate-colored earth and flourish
shyly for a fortnight or so.</p>

<p>A full day’s tramping through orchard after orchard
may win perhaps two dozen of these tiny sponges that
have absorbed the very essence of spring. They are almost
the exact color of the matted, winter-killed grass in
which they nestle to defy all but the most careful searching.
A full day’s work for each two dozen, but never
was a day’s wage more ample, more exquisitely satisfying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Take the hard-won double dozen home. Give them in
reverent silence to the cook. She knows—if, by the grace
of God, she was with you so long ago as the previous
spring—just what to do. She will plop the Morels into
well salted water, there to remain the night through. In
the morning she will place them in a colander to drain
for half an hour. She will then transfer them to a frying
pan of hot butter, where they will sputter and sizzle
for twenty minutes. During that twenty minutes there
will waft into the living room, where you are making
a pitiful pretense of reading the morning paper, an odor
straight from the kitchens of heaven.</p>

<p>You throw down the newspaper and burst with glaring
eyes into the dining room. You seat yourself at the
table and fiddle wildly with knife and fork and spoon....
Years later the waitress appears with a dish and then—I
faint—I swoon—I cannot go on!</p>

<h3>A DIPLOMATIST’S RECEIPT FOR WELSH
RABBIT</h3>

<p>I have no hesitation in saying that my recipe for Welsh
Rabbit is the best yet invented. It has an international
reputation. It has been eaten with gusto by Russians,
Turks and some Englishmen who, strange to say, are
distinguished <i>gourmets</i>. There have been Frenchmen who
were too reserved, perhaps, in their praise of it, but then
it must be remembered that Welsh rabbit is not sympathetic
with the Gallic temperament. The French prefer
<i>timbales de fromage</i>.</p>

<p>Put a large chafing dish over the hot water pan in
which the water must be boiling. Never let the temperature
of the heat change for a moment; therefore a big
alcohol lamp is preferable. Grate ordinary cheese or cut
it into the shape of dice. Drop in a lump of butter of
the size of an English walnut. Pour into the pan a pint
of near beer or near Budweiser. Slightly heat it. In the
old days musty ale was everything. To-day the symbol
of beer is almost sufficient. Drop in a half teaspoonful
of strong red pepper and then a tablespoonful of paprika,—paprika
being merely a flavor and not a condiment. Keep
the beer hot; then drop two tablespoons of Worcestershire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
sauce, a tablespoon of catsup and a half teaspoon of mustard.
When this mixture boils, put in the cheese and
stir in one direction until the mixture assumes the consistency
of cream.</p>

<p>Use the thick plates sold in the department stores especially
for Welsh Rabbit. Have them heated so that the
cheese will sizzle when it touches them. Have ready a
sufficient number of pieces of toasted bread, the crust
carefully cut off. When the cheese is sufficiently plastic,
dip a round of toast into it, let it remain for a second,
transfer it to the hot plate and <i>at once</i> ladle the mixture
in the pan over the toast with neatness and dispatch and
you will have an unprecedented success, if no conversation
is permitted until the rabbit is eaten. The sound of a
human voice lowers its temperature. Coffee or tea must
never be partaken of until the morsels are disposed of.
During the eating process, Budweiser is a substitute for
the real thing—which was musty ale or the Dog’s Head
variety.</p>

<h3>SAUSAGE AND GRIDDLE CAKES</h3>

<p>I think I would say that my favorite dish is sausage
and griddle cakes for breakfast on a cold winter morning.
I would call attention to the fact that the sausages should
be in cake form and not in skins and that the griddle cakes
should be of wheat flour. I am sure there are millions
of Americans who agree with me.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—Here is the best of a dozen tried recipes
for the cakes.</p>

<p>To one cup of Hecker’s, or any excellent self-raising flour
(not pancake!) add a full half cup of milk and a beaten egg
mixed together. A little cream will help at this point, but it
isn’t absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Melt, now, a lump of butter the size of a good big walnut
and stir it into the mixture. Beat for a moment and if the
consistency does not seem just right add a shade more of
milk or flour. The mixture or batter should be about as
thick as molasses in the winter time.</p>

<p>For the very perfection in results bake the cakes on a
soapstone griddle and serve with the best maple syrup obtainable.</p>

<p>This recipe can be safely doubled any number of times and
then some! As above it serves two unless more are desired,
in which case it is easy to duplicate in no time.</p></div>

<h3>LITTLE CHICKEN TARTS</h3>

<p>Here is a dish that I am very fond of and it is really
very easy to prepare. The tart molds may be purchased
already made, which simplifies things somewhat if you
do not want to bother with the dough, but in case you
cannot get them here is the whole process and I can vouch
for the results.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of chopped chicken (cooked) or one large can Chicken à la King</li>
<li>½ cup evaporated milk</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>2 cups sifted flour</li>
<li>½ cup shortening</li>
<li>½ cup water</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>Parsley</li>
<li>Ice water</li></ul>

<p>Mix salt and flour—cut in the chilled shortening with
two knives until the mixture is as fine as meal. With a
broad-bladed knife stir in ice water slowly until dough
clings around knife in a ball, leaving sides of bowl perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
clean. Toss dough on floured bread board. Flour
the rolling pin and roll it out very thin. Keep the pin
well floured. Rub the outside of patty pans or jelly molds
with a little shortening and lay dough over these smoothly,
bringing it well over the edge. Bake upside down for
about ten minutes in a hot oven. If Chicken à la King
is used for a filling it will not require any special preparation,
but if you really want to cook, and you use the cold
chicken, proceed as follows:</p>

<p>Cut the chicken in small pieces, but do not mince.
Mince onion and cook until slightly brown in a little butter.
Stir in a tablespoonful of flour, add milk and water.
When smooth add chicken and season to taste. When
bubbling take from the fire and stir in the slightly beaten
eggs. Let cool, then fill the pastry shells. The remainder
of the pastry dough should have been kept in the ice
box. Get it out. Roll it thin as before. Cut in round
pieces to cover the tops of the tarts. Wet the edges
of the tarts with cold water; press on the covers, bringing
the edges well down as they shrink a bit in baking. Slit
the tops before putting on. Press the edges with tines
of fork. Garnish with parsley.</p>

<h3>LEMON LAYER CAKE</h3>

<p>This, when properly gummy, is as good for a comedian
to throw as a custard pie. Only it’s too good for that
sort of treatment—which sounds rather like an Irish bull!</p>

<p>The layer cake doesn’t interest me especially. After
all, it’s only an excuse for the frosting. Any sort of layer
cake recipe will answer—and, according to the best cook
I know, my grandmother—there are a hundred such
recipes. It’s the filling that I find important. Here is
the rule, and it sounds too simple to be true!</p>

<p>Take one beaten egg, one cup of sugar, the juice and
grated rind of one lemon. Mix them all together, hit
or miss, and place them in a double boiler over a hot fire.
Cook until the mixture begins to get very thick, stirring
constantly. Then take from the stove and beat until the
whole assumes a creamy texture. Spread between the
layers of any cake. This recipe makes enough filling for
two thin layers, or one thick one—which I prefer. It can
be doubled, tripled, and so on—ad infinitum—depending
entirely upon the number of layers in the cake.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Editor’s Note</span>:—This is a good, and unusual, recipe for
layer cake. To two eggs, well beaten, add gradually one cup
of granulated sugar. To one cup of unsifted flour add one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
teaspoonful cream of tartar and one half teaspoonful of soda.
Sift. Then add one half cup of boiling milk with one teaspoonful
of melted butter in it, and one teaspoonful of vanilla.
The mixture will be almost like batter, and should be baked
in two layers.</p></div>

<p>For an ordinary ten-pound turkey <i>steam</i> 2½ hours or
until the muscles of the leg can be readily pierced with a
dining fork. Take steamer from the fire and carefully
remove the turkey to the roasting pan.</p>

<p>Meantime, prepare the dressing as follows: One loaf
of bread, ordinary baker’s size, or same amount of other
bread, slice and toast slowly but thoroughly to a light
golden color; while hot, spread butter on each slice just
as a hungry boy would like it. Place in a deep dish.
The cooked giblets, which, with the juice of one lemon
and three whole large onions, should be ground all together
in a meat grinder with</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon powdered sage</li>
<li>2 teaspoon summer savory</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
</ul>


<p>These should be well sifted and then added to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>ground vegetables and giblets, and with the meat juice
saved from steaming, thoroughly mixed with the bread and
all cut and mashed to about the consistency of thick mush.
After filling, the turkey should be placed in an oven
not too hot, and <i>slowly</i> roasted an hour or more.</p>

<p>Prepared as above, little or no basting will be necessary,
but a few thin slices of bacon laid over the fowl will add
flavor. Add no oysters, eggs, chestnuts or other abominations.</p>

<h3>TO COOK RABBITS</h3>

<p>I do not profess to be a cook of the first rank, or even
the fourth or ninth; but when it comes to cooking rabbits
I’ll put on the kitchen apron with any cook, amateur or
professional, in the country—(managers, please note!).
And I’ll abide by the decision of any judge of rabbit
flesh.</p>

<p>Out in California, where I live most of the time on
my mountain yacht, you can get a lot of rabbits by shooting
them—if you are good. But it’s easier to buy them,
and they taste the same.</p>

<p>To cook a rabbit right do it this way: First—get the
rabbit, clean and cut into six pieces. Soak the pieces in
salt water for several hours—I usually soak ’em all night
and right up to the time for cooking. This whitens and
improves the meat.</p>

<p>When you are ready to cook, dry the pieces; roll them
in a beaten egg and then in cracker crumbs. Put the
pieces into a very hot pan with plenty of butter and fry it
to a golden brown. When the color is right put water
into the pan so that the rabbit is about half covered.
Cover the pan with a tight lid and steam slowly until
the water is all gone. Then serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, if you can substitute an ordinary claret for the
salt water mentioned first, and if you have more claret in
which to steam the fried rabbit you may know the perfect
dish!</p>

<p>I can vouch for all of these:</p>


<h3>VIRGINIA HAM</h3>

<p>Cover an eight-pound ham with cold water. Add a
pint of cider vinegar; one-half pound of brown sugar; six
sticks of cinnamon and a heaping tablespoonful of cloves.
Let this boil for four hours. Push back on the stove and
let it stay all night. In the morning skin it and put it in
a hot oven for half an hour. </p>


<h3>LEMON PIE</h3>

<p>The filling: In a cup full of sugar mix thoroughly a
heaping tablespoonful and one-half of flour. Grate the
skin of one lemon, and add the juice. Then add the yolks
of two eggs and a cup of water, also a pinch of salt. Stir
this thoroughly, all together. Put into a double boiler
and let it cook until it is thick and smooth. Then pour
it into the cooked pie crust. Add a teaspoonful of water
to the whites of the eggs, and a pinch of salt. Then beat
until stiff. Cover your pie with this mixture and then
sprinkle granulated sugar on top of the meringue. Don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
mix the sugar and the meringue. Put under the broiler
to brown.</p>

<p>The crust: Mix two good sized tablespoonfuls of lard
with one and a half cups of flour. Mix this with your
fingers thoroughly, until it feels like corn meal, although
much larger. Add ice water until the mixture holds together;
then roll on a floured board. In baking the
crust for a lemon pie, either puncture the crust all over
with a fork or bake it on the outside of your pie tin.
This will keep the crust from creeping. </p>


<h3>A DRESSING</h3>

<p class='center'>(For stuffed tomatoes, cold meat or potato salad.)</p>

<p>Melt a large tablespoonful of butter. Add a saucer
of vinegar to the yolks of two eggs. Then add a teaspoonful
of dry mustard and a teaspoonful of sugar. Stir
the mixture—sugar and eggs—into the vinegar; then add
it to the butter which you have on the stove, melting.
Keep stirring this until it gets thick, and remember that
it will be much thicker when it is cold. In case you wish
to use this for potato salad, don’t make it very thick.</p>

<h3>TIPS ON STEAK</h3>

<p>“Why can’t we have steaks like this one when we dine
at home?” Thousands of people have asked me that
question during the eight years that have given a real
significance to the sobriquet, “Beefsteak Charlie.”</p>

<p>And my honest answer to that question has always
been: “<i>You can’t</i>—unless your butcher is willing to <i>hang
your beef for four or five weeks</i>—and then you probably
would not want to buy it because of its appearance.”</p>

<p>Many people ask me how to cook a steak. There is
really no secret about the way it should be done—but
most home cooks put the steak into a cold broiler and
light the fire. That is fatal! And it is just as fatal if
the fire has only been burning a few minutes. The
broiler should burn full tilt for some time—until it is
blazing hot. Then introduce your steak and let the <i>intense
heat</i> of the broiler seal it instantly. If there is a
secret, that’s it!</p>

<p>But keep this in mind: the most careful broiling will
not help if the beef is too fresh. Fresh beef simply will
not do if you want the real thing. Buy the choicest cuts
of sirloin or porterhouse from beef that has been hung at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
least four weeks; broil in the way I have described and
your dinner guests will register many polite hints for another
invitation. I might add that if the beef is right
you will not have to worry about a sauce. Butter, salt,
and pepper will properly dress the finest steak in the
world.</p>

<h3>SALADE Á LA TURC</h3>

<p>I don’t profess to shine much as a cook. I would
rather have somebody do it for me, but there are one or
two things that I sometimes like to fix on my own hook.</p>

<p>Years ago there was some sort of a Centennial Exposition
out in Nashville, Tenn. I don’t remember what
they had to celebrate, but at any rate I had to take it in.
I didn’t know a soul and good old Al Williams, the snake
man—who died last year—gave me a letter of introduction
to the Turk who ran the Hoochy-Koochy show on
the midway. It is the only time I ever used a letter of
introduction with efficiency and delectation. This Turk—who,
incidentally, was one of the finest looking chaps I
ever saw, and a man of education—welcomed me with
open arms. First of all I had to see the show, and I
was so enthusiastic about the gyrations of the sumptuous
beauties that he did me the great honor of asking me to
dine with him, <i>en famille</i>. It was a great experience.
All the Hoochy-koochy dancers were there, in their stage
costumes, with ma and pa and mother-in-law, and
mother’s great uncle and a rabble of other folks, large and
small. We had a lot of funny things to eat, but there
was one dish that really appealed to me. They called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
it “Salada” and I ate of it in such copious portions that
my friend, the Turk, insisted on showing me how it was
made. I have made it many times since for my own
pleasure, at least—and most folk who try it once will try
it again.</p>

<p>It is a salad of ripe tomatoes, cucumbers and onions.
The main point is that you must not slice them up but—after
you peel your onions, cucumbers and tomatoes—put
them whole into a chopping bowl, and chop them into
chunks with a chopping knife. The chunks should be
about as large as the end of your thumb. After the
chopping operation, put the whole business on the ice
until it gets good and cold. Then drain off the juice.</p>

<p>Add a sharp French dressing, get a big spoon and a
plate and go to it. If it doesn’t taste good, I’ll eat it
myself. </p>


<h3>PANDORA FRENCH DRESSING</h3>

<p>I have discovered that the secret of French dressing, to
my way of thinking, is to use plenty of salt. When I
make it at home—say for five or six people—I take an
ordinary salt dish or saucer and cover the bottom with a
lot of salt. Add black pepper and some of that Chili
powder that comes from a place down in Texas. This
Chili powder has a better flavor than paprika, and has a
sort of onion taste to it, but don’t use too much of it.
Then I cover this with a good quantity of olive oil and
beat it up with a fork until it gets stiff. It is a good
idea to have the olive oil cold. Then add your vinegar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>—good,
old-fashioned cider vinegar. There is a lot of
it around nowadays because, while it is easy to turn sweet
cider into hard, it is a good deal easier to turn hard cider
into vinegar. You add the vinegar to suit your taste—and
this depends a good deal on the kind of salad you are
going to have. For asparagus I like the dressing a little
tart. For lettuce, not so tart. But this is a matter you
can easily adjust to your own satisfaction. </p>


<h3>WELSH RABBIT Á LA MORGAN ROBERTSON</h3>

<p>I wonder how many folk who read these pages remember
Morgan Robertson. Poor old Morgan is dead
and gone, now, but in his day he wrote some of the best
sea stories ever put into English. He used to keep bachelor
hall in a funny little studio down on 25th Street,
off Sixth Avenue, New York—and when his friends
came to call his special delight was a Welsh Rabbit. He
told me how to make it, and I am trying to pass the
recipe on. The beauty of Robertson’s rabbit was that it
never got stringy.</p>

<p>First you put a good-sized lump of butter into a chafing
dish and let it sizzle. Add some Coleman’s mustard and
paprika and stir it round a bit. For six people I would
use two pounds of cheese. Real old New York State
full cream cheese—none of this odoriferous imported stuff.
The kind of cheese they used to make down on the farm.
Cut it up in chunks and put it in the pan with a little
beer (near beer will do), or you could use milk. Keep
adding a little more beer as the cheese commences to melt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and put in a little Worcestershire sauce, if you like it.
When it is well melted take a heaping tablespoonful of
corn starch, mix it with a little water, and mix it with
the mess. Meanwhile keep stirring it. Let it bubble
and when it comes to the consistency of pancake batter
(meanwhile keep stirring it—you can’t stir it too much!)
it is ready to serve. And please serve it on toasted bread.
If there is anything makes me tired, it is to have Welsh
Rabbit served on crackers—it isn’t the same thing. Don’t
be afraid the rabbit will get stringy, because it won’t.
Some folks put the corn starch in dry, instead of mixing
it with water. Either way is right. Season it to suit
yourself. But for the love of Mike don’t beat an egg
up in it. That’s another kind of fish entirely.</p>

<h3>WATERZOIE DE VOLAILLE</h3>

<p>Without doubt the most popular national dish of Belgium
is Waterzoie de Volaille—a most delectable and
satisfying soup of chicken. In Brussels the dish reaches
perfection under the magic of the chef of the famous restaurant
the “Filet de Sole,” known to amateurs of good
cooking in almost every country of Europe.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you how they do it at the “Filet de
Sole.” First of course you will secure a fine young fowl—chicken—and,
after it has been perfectly cleaned and
dressed, you will rub it well with a piece of lemon. Now
cut it up as you would for frying.</p>

<p>Next prepare the casserole or vessel in which the
soup will be made by generously buttering the sides and
bottom. Over the bottom of the vessel place a bed of fine
julienne composed of one third of fine white celery (remove
all fibers or “strings”) one-third of the white part
of leek and one-third of white onion. To this add a
bouquet composed of a half leaf of laurel, a <i>soupçon</i> of
thyme enclosed in a few roots of parsley, the roots having
been well scraped and washed.</p>

<p>Upon this bed place the pieces of chicken and over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
whole pour a little more than a quart of dry white wine
and veal broth—one third broth and two thirds wine.
Water may be used instead of the broth but the latter
is preferable. Season with kitchen salt, freshly ground
white pepper and a pinch of clove.</p>

<p>Bring the mixture to the boiling point and allow it to
simmer and steam under a tight cover for at least thirty-five
minutes.</p>

<p>Take out the bouquet and pass the roots through a
metal strainer. The extract is to be added to the soup.
Now add a large pinch of bread crumbs.</p>

<p>At this point you will turn the soup into a large tureen
and quickly add the rapidly beaten yolks of four eggs,
two wine glasses of extra thick cream and a few thimblefuls
of fine butter.</p>

<p>Complete the liaison by adding the pieces of chicken
and, with a final sprinkle of chopped parsley, the Waterzoie
is ready for the table and for your delectation.</p>

<h3>SPAGHETTI-MY-STYLE</h3>

<p>After thinking over all of the dishes that I like—searching
for the favorite—I come right back to the old
standby, Spaghetti, and am forced to admit that it is my
favorite.</p>

<p>You know how to cook the spaghetti itself, I’m sure, so
I will just tell you how to make the sauce that I concocted
some years ago and you’ll like it.</p>

<p>Get a big iron kettle and put into it a lot of fine beef
cut into small squares, some chopped bacon, dried mushrooms
(the kind you get at any little Italian store) a
can of tomatoes and some sliced onions. The dried
mushrooms should be soaked for an hour or two before
cooking.</p>

<p>Cover the materials with plenty of water and season
with salt, brown sugar, and Mexican chili powder. Cook
slowly all day—the longer the better, I find.</p>

<p>When you are simply famished and cannot wait any
longer, ladle the sauce onto the steaming hot spaghetti
and enjoy a real meal. The sauce is still better, in my
opinion, when warmed up the second day.</p>
